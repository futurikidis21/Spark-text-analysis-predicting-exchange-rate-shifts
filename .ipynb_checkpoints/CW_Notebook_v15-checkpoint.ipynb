    "**Abstract_** This notebook presents pySpark code that implements a machine-learning pipeline, which (a) scrapes and processes daily reports on debates at the House of Commons and the House of Lords; (b) scrapes daily GBP-EUR exchange rates and calculates their day-to-day shifts; and (c) links the two to train a regression-based algorithm that predicts the latter from the former. The analysis focuses on the prediction exchange-rate shifts(instead of raw exchange rates) to overcome the implications of autocorrelation for the modelling process. Alternative model hyperparameters are systematically assessed using a grid-search approach, which involves training, validating, and testing the performance of alternative model specifications.   "

access to credit for businesses in stafford constituency in the last months anna soubry the small business enterprise and employment act contained two specific policies to support small and medium sized enterprises smes in accessing finance the first requires major banks to refer smes they reject for finance to designated finance platforms that can help match smes with alternative finance providers this will ensure that viable smes including businesses in stafford that may not fit the major banks risk appetite can still get the finance they need to grow and expand three platforms have recently been designated by hm treasury on the advice of the british business bank and are expected to come into operation later this year the second requires the major banks to share information on their sme customers with the sme s permission with other lenders through designated credit reference agencies this will improve the ability of challenger banks and alternative finance providers to conduct accurate risk assessments and level the playing field between providers and make it easier for smes to get finance from providers other than their bank the government is supporting the peer to peer pp and crowdfunding sectors which provide alternative sources of finance for both businesses and individuals the british business bank for example has invested m in smes via five pp platforms

been required to hold a register of people with significant control psc register the register records the ultimate owners and controllers of uk companies it is designed to record individuals however where a company is owned by another company that is also required to hold a psc register or is subject to equivalent disclosure requirements those companies should be recorded on the register where a company is owned and or controlled by a third party incorporation agent including trust and company service providers tcsp and they are also required to hold a psc register or are subject to equivalent transparency requirements then they would be required to be registered on that company s psc register if the third party incorporation agent is not required to hold its own psc register then the uk company would be required to look further up the ownership chain to identify who owns and controls the tcsp the ultimate owner would be recorded on the psc register where a third party incorporation agent has incorporated a company on behalf of someone else and they do not own or control the company then the register would not record the third party incorporation agent details it would instead record who actually owns and controls that uk company how the psc register works is explained in detailed guidance that has been prepared by bis with the help of a working group of
