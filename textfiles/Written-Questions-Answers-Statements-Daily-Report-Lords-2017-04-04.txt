Helping Workless Families 

[HLWS590] 

Lord Henley: Today, we are publishing “Improving 

Lives: Helping Workless Families”, setting out this 

Government’s vision to improve outcomes for children 

who grow up in workless families and face multiple, 

associated disadvantages. 

This Government is committed to creating a country 

that works for everyone. We want to create a fairer 

Britain where success is based on merit, not privilege, and 

where everyone has the chance to go as far as their talents 

and hard work will take them. 

We have already made great steps in rebalancing 

society in favour of ordinary working people: 

employment runs at a record high and unemployment is at 

the lowest rate for over a decade. There are now 590,000 

fewer children in workless households compared to 2010. 

However, despite this progress, for some families, 

worklessness, not employment, is the norm. In 2014-2015 

there were 1.8 million children in workless families 

across the United Kingdom, and in over eight out of ten 

cases the child was in a long-term workless family. These 

families often face multiple disadvantages – for example, 

relationship distress is almost three times as prevalent in 

workless couple-parent families compared to when both 

parents are working. 

Today, we are publishing new analysis which shows 

what a profound impact worklessness and its associated 

multiple disadvantages can have on children’s emotional, 

behavioural and educational outcomes. Our ground-

breaking research shows children in workless families are 

almost twice as likely to fail to reach the expected 

standard at all stages of their education. Evidence also 

shows how exposure to parental conflict can have long-

term negative impacts on children’s early development. 

We must act now to break this cycle of disadvantage. 

Today, we are introducing four major new policies 

which will transform local services so that they can better 

support workless families: 

- The next phase of the Troubled Families programme, 

to place a greater emphasis on supporting parents with 

complex problems back into work; 

- A major programme to reduce stress and conflict in 

workless families; 

- Enhancing the role of Jobcentre Plus in working with 

local partners to tackle collectively the multiple 

disadvantages facing unemployed individuals in a better, 

more joined-up way; and 

- Greater support to help those with drug and alcohol 

dependencies into work, in response to recommendations 

from Dame Carol Black’s review of employment support 

for those with drug/alcohol dependencies. 

My colleague the Secretary of State for Communities 

and Local Government has published the Troubled 

Families Annual Report today, which sets out more detail 

on the next phase of the programme and should be read in 

conjunction with the document I am announcing today. 

To track our collective progress in improving outcomes 

for disadvantaged families, we are introducing nine 

national indicators, as set out in our Analysis and 

Research Pack. These will build on our two statutory 

indicators of parental worklessness and children’s 

educational attainment – for which I am publishing the 

first annual report today. I will lay this report formally in 

Parliament on 24 April. 

We will break down our evidence to a local level, to 

enable local partners to understand and identify the needs 

of their community. We will continue to work with local 

agencies and partners on a range of tools, including our 

Family Evidence Resource, to help them use our new 

evidence to commission and deliver effective 

interventions for workless families. 

The analysis and evidence we have developed – in 

conjunction with leading academics and experts, as well 

as other Government departments – takes us further than 

ever before in understanding the root causes of 

disadvantage. 

The indicators and evidence base we are introducing 

form a framework for action – and in doing so, help to 

drive improvements in children and families’ lives, now 

and over time. By targeting services on the issues that 

prevent parents moving into work and cause instability in 

family life, Government, working with local authorities 

and other partners, can help workless families and their 

children overcome their problems and improve their lives. 

Troubled Families Annual Report 

[HLWS591] 

Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth: As required by the 

Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016, section 3(1) and 

(11), my Department will publish the first annual report 

today setting out how the current Troubled Families 

Programme (2015 – 2020) has been supporting the most 

disadvantaged families. We will lay this report after 

recess on 24 April 2017. 

This notice details what the report will cover, for the 

period up to end of March 2017, as well as for the next 

financial year, including setting out which families are 

eligible for the programme and how the progress of 

families supported will be measured. 

Families classed as ‘Relevant households’ on the 

programme, as defined by section 3 of the Welfare 

Reform and Work Act 2016, have at least two of the 

following problems: 

• Parents or children involved in crime or anti-social 

behaviour

Page 2 4 April 2017 Written Statements 

• Children who are not attending school regularly 

• Children who need help; that is children of all ages, 

who need help, are identified as in need or are subject 

to a child protection plan 

• Adults out of work or at risk of financial exclusion or 

young people at risk of worklessness 

• Families affected by domestic violence or abuse 

• Parents or children with a range of physical and 

mental health problems 

The rationale for these eligibility criteria and how local 

authorities should identify families using a range of 

indicators, suggested referral routes and information 

sources was set out in the Financial framework for the 

expanded Troubled Families programme: April 2015 

onwards published on 5 March 2015. The Financial 

Framework also sets out how the progress of families 

supported will be measured. 

‘Supporting disadvantaged families, Troubled Families 

Programme 2015–2020: progress so far’ sets out how the 

programme is changing the way councils work to be more 

effective in supporting those in need, including through a 

whole family approach and co-ordinated practical 

support. It also includes considerations for the next phase 

of the programme including which families are eligible 

for support, and how their progress will be measured. 

The programme will continue support for 

disadvantaged families with complex problems and will 

work with up to 400,000 families by 2020. 

The next phase of the Troubled Families Programme 

supports the Government’s paper, Improving Lives: 

Helping Workless Families. This sets out new evidence 

on the multiple and overlapping disadvantages 

experienced by workless families – including parental 

conflict and problem debt. 

As part of the next phase of the programme, the 

Government will be conducting a review of the current 

payment-by-results funding model. This is to make sure 

that this model continues to help the programme meet its 

objectives, and to strengthen the programme’s funding 

requirements.

Apprentices: Training 

Asked by Lord Watson of Invergowrie 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how many further 

education colleges rated (1) good, or (2) outstanding, by 

Ofsted were not included on the Register of 

Apprenticeship Training Providers announced on 14 

March. [HL6438] 

Asked by Lord Watson of Invergowrie 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what steps they 

are taking to assist those further education colleges 

which were not included on the Register of 

Apprenticeship Training Providers announced on 14 

March. [HL6439] 

Asked by Lord Watson of Invergowrie 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how many 

training providers with no previous history of delivering 

apprenticeships were included on the Register of 

Apprenticeship Training Providers announced on 14 

March. [HL6440] 

Lord Nash: More than 1,700 providers made it onto 

the Register of Apprenticeship Training Providers (the 

Register) in the first round – three quarters of those who 

applied – including 173 FE colleges. There were no 

further education colleges rated outstanding by Ofsted 

that were not included, however seventeen colleges that 

were rated good overall by Ofsted were not included on 

the basis that they failed to meet the broader set of criteria 

against which all applicants were assessed. To ensure 

excellence for apprenticeship provision we cannot 

compromise on our commitment to rigorous quality tests 

for apprenticeship training. 

We have already re-opened the Register for new 

applications and to allow those who were unsuccessful to 

reapply. We will announce the results by the end of May. 

We have provided detailed feedback to providers who 

were not successful in their initial application, to help 

them understand what they need to do to be successful in 

the future. 

The new Register opens up the current apprenticeship 

market to wider competition. We have sought to 

encourage new providers to come forward who do not 

have a tradition of delivering apprenticeships. There are 

451 organisations that we consider to have no previous 

history of delivering apprenticeships. These include 

Universities, charities, public sector bodies, employers 

and other private/commercial providers. This will give 

employers a wider choice of providers and create a 

broader range of training for individual apprentices to 

benefit from. 

Army: Young People 

Asked by Lord Judd 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what 

arrangements they are making to ensure that the Army 

Review of Junior Entry (1) seeks and considers external 

evidence, (2) considers how the armed services can be 

exemplary standard setters in fulfilling their duty of 

care and support for young recruits, and (3) examines 

the proportion of young Army recruits who are destined 

for a future in the infantry; and what assessment they 

have made of the implications of the higher death and 

casualty rates in the infantry service for recruitment 

practices. [HL6299] 

Earl Howe: I refer the noble Lord to the answers given 

by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Armed 

Forces (Mike Penning), in the House of Commons on 27 

February 2017 to Question number 64193 and on 14 

March 2017 to Question number 67005. The Army is 

consulting with the Departments for Education, Health 

and Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. 

The Army is conducting a review of its Junior Entry 

policy to ensure it attracts the best young people and 

continues to maximise the talent of the individual, to the 

mutual advantage of both the young person and the Army. 

The review will report initial findings later this year. 

All recruits joining the Army, including those between 

the ages of 16 and 18, are recruited into a variety of roles 

depending on their aptitude and available vacancies. The 

Ministry of Defence does not make assessments of death 

and casualty rates in the context of recruitment practices.

Atrial Fibrillation 

Asked by Lord Black of Brentwood 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

Written Answer by Lord Prior of Brampton on 13 July 

2016 (HL1005), whether the UK National Screening 

Committee has considered the timing of its review of 

the evidence for screening people aged 65 and over for 

atrial fibrillation; and whether there will be an 

opportunity for organisations to submit evidence to that 

review. [HL6362] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: Where the UK National 

Screening Committee (UK NSC) does not recommend 

screening for a particular condition, the evidence is 

reviewed again in three years as part of its regular review 

cycle. The next evidence review for atrial fibrillation is 

expected to commence in 2017/18. 

If any new published peer reviewed evidence emerges 

before the upcoming review, which may change the

current recommendation, individuals or organisations may 

alert the UK NSC to this. 

Asked by Lord Black of Brentwood 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what action they 

are taking to identify people with atrial fibrillation at 

high risk of stroke who are (1) not anticoagulated, or (2) 

not maintained in therapeutic range. [HL6364] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: The National Institute for 

Health and Care Excellence has produced guidance and 

quality standards on anticoagulation for people with atrial 

fibrillation. NHS England has identified improved 

management of atrial fibrillation as a priority for reducing 

premature mortality. 

Tools are available that enable general practitioners 

(GPs) to monitor whether patients are in the therapeutic 

range or not. There are also incentives for GPs to ensure 

that atrial fibrillation patients receive appropriate 

anticoagulation. 

NHS England continue to support and promote the use 

of an audit tool that enables GPs to search patients’ data 

in order to identify patients at a high risk of atrial 

fibrillation, and then review those patients’ treatment 

options. In practices that use the tool regularly, there has 

been an increase in high risk patients prescribed oral 

anticoagulants (from 61% to 68%), with a corresponding 

decrease in high risk patients prescribed antiplatelets, 

such as aspirin (from 28% to 21%). 

Brexit 

Asked by Lord Empey 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what steps they 

are taking to ensure that they have the necessary 

resources to manage the transition of powers from the 

EU, in relation to (1) central government departments, 

and (2) assessing and managing the impact of leaving 

the EU on the devolution settlements. [HL6227] 

Lord Bridges of Headley: We constantly review and 

monitor the size of the Civil Service workforce to meet 

the Prime Minister’s priorities. 

The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced £412m of 

additional funding to support EU exit and trade policy. 

The Civil Service is focused on delivering the 

Government’s commitment to leave the European Union 

and get the very best deal for the UK. We are equipping 

ourselves with the right people and the right skills across 

government to make this happen, and keeping our plans - 

and ability to deliver them - under constant review. 

Care Homes 

Asked by Lord Warner 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government whether NHS 

hospital trusts are permitted to purchase residential or 

nursing home beds for patients who no longer need to 

occupy an acute hospital bed but cannot be discharged 

to a social care placement. [HL6253] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: National Health Service trusts 

are able to purchase residential and nursing care but we 

would expect them to do this in a planned way with their 

local clinical commissioning group and local authority. 

Channel Four Television: Public 

Appointments 

Asked by Lord Ouseley 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

Written Answer by Lord Ashton of Hyde on 21 March 

(HL5834), whether the female candidate who was not 

approved for appointment by the Secretary of State 

failed to meet the skills and experience set out in the 

advertised job descriptions; and if so, whether they have 

determined that Ofcom was wrong to recommend her as 

suitably qualified to be appointed. [HL6217] 

Asked by Lord Ouseley 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

Written Answer by Lord Ashton of Hyde on 21 March 

(HL5834), whether the reason why the female 

candidate who was not approved for appointment by the 

Secretary of State was that the Department for Culture, 

Media and Sport targets of 50 per cent and 10 per cent 

for female and BAME candidates, respectively, had 

already been exceeded, that the female candidate was 

from a minority ethnic background, whereas the 

successful four men appointed were not, or for some 

other reason. [HL6218] 

Lord Ashton of Hyde: Non-executive members of the 

Channel 4 Corporation board are appointed by Ofcom 

with the approval of the Secretary of State. Ofcom 

advertised for four vacancies for candidates with specific 

sector skills and experience. The Secretary of State 

approved the four candidates on the basis that they met 

the skills and experience set out in the advertised job 

descriptions. 

Conditions of Employment 

Asked by Lord Monks 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what plans they 

have to transpose into UK legislation, both pre- and 

post-Brexit, all European employment rights. [HL6239] 

Lord Prior of Brampton: The Government remains 

committed to protecting and enhancing workers’ rights 

following the UK’s exit from the EU. All employment 

rights which currently apply in the UK, including those 

derived from EU law, will continue to be guaranteed after 

exit. The Great Repeal Bill will provide the mechanism 

for this.

adults with special learning needs; and what progress 

was made in (1) 2015, and (2) 2016. [HL6224] 

Lord Henley: The Government strongly supports the 

need to provide more employment opportunities to adults 

with a learning disability or autism. 

In 2015 3,140 individuals with a learning disability 

started the Work Choice programme, with 61% achieving 

a job outcome. 2016 annual data are not yet available. In 

2015 the department introduced Specialist Employability 

Support (SES) to provide up to a further 1700 places per 

year intensive and personalised support for people, 

including those with learning disabilities. 

Disability Confident works to influence employers to 

take on more disabled people, including those with 

learning disabilities, and to market Access to Work to 

disabled people. 

Access to Work has a new Hidden Impairment Support 

Team which aims to give advice and guidance to 

employers, and offers eligible workers an assessment of 

their needs at work and a support plan. 

Last year, Paul Maynard MP led a taskforce that made 

recommendations to Government on how to improve 

access to apprenticeships for people with learning 

disabilities. Department for Work and Pensions and the 

Department for Education are working together to 

implement all of these recommendations. 

Looking forward, we are testing ways to improve our 

support for people with learning disabilities through a 

Local Supported Employment proof of concept and 

Supported Work Experience for young people, which 

offers young people with learning disabilities and other 

long term conditions a chance to spend time with an 

employer. 

European Economic Area 

Asked by Lord Green of Deddington 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government whether an 

application by a country to become party to the EEA 

Agreement requires the agreement of each individual 

EU member state or of the Council of the EU; and, if 

the latter, whether the matter would have to be decided 

by unanimity or by qualified majority. [HL6164] 

Lord Bridges of Headley: To become party to the 

European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement a State must 

first be in either the EU or European Free Trade 

Association (EFTA). Applications are made to the EEA 

Council leading to an agreement which is subject to 

unanimous agreement and subsequent ratification by all 

Contracting Parties. 

As the Prime Minister has made clear, we will not be 

remaining a member of the Single Market and do not 

intend to rejoin the EEA. 

Hercules Aircraft 

Asked by Lord Robathan 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how many hours 

the RAF fleet of C-130Js has flown in each year since 

entering service; and what was the average cost per 

flying hour for the C-130J over the same period. 

[HL6359] 

Earl Howe: The first C-130J was delivered in 1998. 

The information requested on the C-130J is not held 

centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate 

cost.

[HL6257] 

Asked by Lord Blencathra 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government when they expect 

to respond to the recommendations of the Competition 

and Markets Authority’s legal services market study 

report, published on 15 December 2016, and what 

assessment they have made of the implications of their 

report regarding the ability for legal regulators to 

investigate and rule on the ethics, conduct and 

behaviour of lawyers. [HL6258] 

Asked by Lord Blencathra 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government whether they have 

received any representations regarding the ability of 

legal regulators to bring prosecutions against solicitors 

for breaches of the law, and any proposals for that 

ability to be strengthened; and if so, whether they agree 

with those representations. [HL6259] 

Asked by Lord Blencathra 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment 

they have made of the conclusion in the Competition 

and Markets Authority’s market study into legal 

services, published on 15 December 2016, that legal 

service regulators should be independent of their 

representative bodies as a "matter of principle"; and 

whether they have made any assessment of the possible 

benefits of such a move. [HL6260] 

Lord Keen of Elie: The government has not yet issued 

a consultation on making legal services regulators 

independent from their representative bodies, and will 

respond to the Competition and Markets Authority’s 

report and recommendations shortly. 

The final report of the Insurance Fraud Task Force 

(January 2016) included a recommendation that the 

government should consider strengthening the 

enforcement powers of the Solicitors Regulation 

Authority. We are reviewing the position on this and 

considering what further action may be appropriate. 

Maritime Patrol Aircraft 

Asked by Lord Campbell of Pittenweem 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government when they expect 

that testing and evaluation in the US of the Boeing-P8A 

aircraft being purchased by the UK will be completed. 

[HL6358] 

Earl Howe: The Poseidon P-8A maritime patrol 

aircraft being procured for the Royal Air Force is a 

mature capability that is already being operated by the US 

Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force, therefore the 

initial test and evaluation of the aircraft is complete. 

However, through a programme of planned capability 

development and upgrades, the P-8A will progressively 

deliver yet further capability which provides confidence it 

will meet current and future UK key user requirements. 

The test and evaluation of these increments is therefore 

on-going.

Asked by Baroness Hollins 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what estimate they 

have made of the number of people currently receiving 

the standard mobility rate of Personal Independence 

Payment who will not be entitled to receive any 

mobility rate following their next reassessment, 

following changes brought forward in the Social 

Security (Personal Independence Payment) 

(Amendment) Regulations 2017; and what assessment 

they have made of the impact of that change on those 

individuals. [HL6213] 

Lord Henley: No Personal Independence Payment 

(PIP) claimants will see a reduction in the amount of PIP 

previously awarded by the Department for Work and 

Pensions as a result of the regulations being introduced, 

including the point at which their claim is next reviewed. 

We are aware of a small number of cases, where people 

may have been awarded a higher level of PIP by a 

tribunal. This could occur if their case was heard at appeal 

and a tribunal made a higher award, applying the rulings 

of the Upper Tribunal. We will not be claiming back the 

money these individuals received during the period before 

the new regulations came into force and are considering 

whether to adjust their payments to bring them in line 

with the amended PIP regulations. 

I will place a copy of the Equality Impact Assessment 

in the House Library.

currently receive the Personal Independence Payment 

and who at their original assessment (or following 

mandatory reconsideration or appeal) scored points by 

satisfying descriptors 1c, 1d and 1f of the mobility

Prisons: Civil Disorder

has been paid to Carillion as a result of damage to 

prison property during disorders and riots in the last 

five years. [HL6063] 

Asked by Baroness Corston 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what estimates 

they have made of the amount of money likely to be 

paid to Carillion as a result of prison disorders and riots 

in the last five years. [HL6064] 

Lord Keen of Elie: The following amounts have been 

paid, or are forecast to be paid, to Carillion in respect of 

concerted indiscipline at the following sites since Total 

Facilities Management contracts commenced on 1st June 

2015: 

Establishment Amount paid Amounts forecast to be 
payable 

Bedford - £444,813 

Swaleside £14,452 Final amount to be 
confirmed following 

completion and 

verification of work 
undertaken 

Lewes £166,762.12 - 

Erlestoke £631,468 £168,026 

We will continue to closely monitor Carillion’s 

performance and have robust processes in place to ensure 

they are fulfilling their contractual requirements. 

It is right that prison repair work is carried out in a 

timely and effective manner to ensure public protection. 

We always work to ensure we achieve value for money 

for the taxpayer and keep our costs under review.

Social Services: Finance 

Asked by Lord Warner 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

Written Answer by Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth on 23 

December 2016 (HL4083), which local authorities in 

England with responsibility for adult social care will 

not be using their precept raising power to the 

maximum permitted level in 2017–18 to fund adult 

social care. [HL6249] 

Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth: Council tax levels set 

by local authorities in England for 2017-18 were 

published (attached) on 29 March - 

https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/council-tax-

levels-set-by-local-authorities-in-england-2017-to-2018. 

In 2017-18, 147 out of 152 adult social care authorities 

will use some or all of the 3 per cent adult social care 

precept flexibility when setting their council tax, with 109 

using the full, or close to full, 3 per cent. I will place a list 

of local authorities which will not be using their precept 

raising power to the maximum permitted level in 2017-18 

to fund adult social care in the House library.

Asked by Lord Shipley 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what exceptions 

have been made to the application of the regulations

disintegrated, the remains are to be buried with the staff, 

lion and crown colour pole mount, in consecrated ground 

without any marking.
