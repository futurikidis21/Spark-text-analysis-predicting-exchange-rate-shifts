Schools Capital Allocations 

[HLWS589] 

Lord Nash: Today, I am announcing £2.4 billion of 

capital funding to create new school places needed by 

September 2020 and to maintain and improve the 

condition of school buildings. This forms part of our 

wider plan to invest more than £24 billion in the school 

estate by 2021. 

We want to build a country that works for everyone – 

and that means providing a good school place for every 

child, one that offers them the opportunity to fulfil their 

potential. Investing in our school buildings and creating a 

sufficient amount of school places are key parts of the 

Government’s plan to ensure that every child has the 

opportunity of a place at a good school, whatever their 

background. 

We are committed to investing £7 billion in this 

Parliament to create new school places. Together with our 

further investment in free schools we expect this to 

deliver 600,000 new school places over the course of the 

Parliament. We have already announced £4.8 billion of 

funding to local authorities for 2015-19, and today we are 

announcing a further £980 million for 2019-20, taking 

total investment so far through this Parliament to £5.8 

billion. In doing so, we continue to recognise that good 

investment decisions require certainty. Announcing 

allocations for 2019-20 today means local authorities can 

plan years ahead with confidence, and make good 

strategic investment decisions to ensure they deliver good 

school places for every child who needs one. 

Alongside this new funding we are publishing data 

from the 2016 School Capacity Survey, which highlights 

the progress made by local authorities to date in providing 

new school places using our previous investment. By May 

2016, our investment had already helped to create nearly 

735,000 additional school places since 2010, with 

136,000 delivered in 2015/16 alone. 

Alongside this investment in new school places, we are 

committing more than £10 billion over 2016-2021 to 

maintain and improve the condition of the school estate. 

As part of this, I am today confirming allocations of £1.2 

billion for local authorities, voluntary aided partnerships, 

multi-academy trusts and academy sponsors to invest in 

their own condition priorities, and a further £0.2 billion of 

Devolved Formula Capital directly to schools in the 

financial year 2017-18. This allocation includes the 

Condition Improvement Fund which is providing funding 

of £466 million for 1,435 projects across 1,184 academies 

and sixth-form colleges. These projects will help to 

ensure that children across the country have access to a 

good school place, further supporting them to reach their 

full potential. 

This funding will help improve the quality of school 

buildings across the country – targeting schools with the 

highest need. It can also help schools reduce their running 

costs, by replacing outdated facilities with buildings that 

are more efficient to run. So I want schools, local 

authorities and academy trusts to look carefully at how 

they can achieve the best value from this investment. 

Details of today’s announcement will be published on 

the GOV.UK website, and copies will be placed in the 

libraries of both Houses. 

Service Complaints Ombudsman: Annual 

Report 

[HLWS588] 

Earl Howe: I am pleased to lay before Parliament 

today the Service Complaints Ombudsman’s annual 

report for 2016 on the fairness, effectiveness and 

efficiency of the service complaints system. 

This report is published by Nicola Williams, her first as 

Service Complaints Ombudsman, and covers the first year 

of operation of the new service complaints system and the 

work of her office in 2016. 

The new service complaints system was introduced on 

1 January 2016. The system is shorter, seeks to promote 

greater confidence in the system and strengthens the 

oversight and accountability through the powers of the 

Ombudsman. I am pleased that the report acknowledges 

the good work undertaken by each of the Services in 2016 

as they have implemented the new system. The 

Ombudsman also reports on those areas where further 

work is required to improve the way in which complaints 

are handled, and makes twelve new recommendations. 

The findings of the report and the recommendations 

made will now be considered in detail, and a formal 

response to the Ombudsman will follow once that work is 

complete.

Written Answers 
Monday, 3 April 2017 

Air Force 

Asked by Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what is their 

estimate of the number of RAF pilots who already 

possess private pilot’s licences on joining the service. 

[HL6452] 

Earl Howe: This information is not held. The RAF 

does not record extra-curricular qualifications held by 

entrants into the RAF. 

Air Pollution 

Asked by Lord Hunt of Chesterton 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

reply by the Prime Minister on 8 March 2017 (HC Deb, 

col 807), what data they have collected that shows an 

improvement in air quality in recent years. [HL6317] 

Lord Gardiner of Kimble: The UK's National 

Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI) is compiled 

annually to report total emissions by pollutant and source 

sector in a systematic way, and to facilitate compliance 

with EU emission ceilings and targets. 

An overview of this information and the trends in air 

pollution since 1970 is publicly available in the latest 

National Statistics publication ‘Air Pollutants in the UK, 

1970 to 2015’, which was published on 21 December 

2016. 

Emissions data demonstrate a long term decrease in the 

emissions of all of the main air pollutants between 1970 

and 2015. Emissions of: 

• sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) reduced by 96%; 

• nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 69%; 

• non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) 

by 66%; 

• particulate matter: PM 10  by 73% and PM 2.5  by 

76%. 

In addition, ammonia (NH3) emissions from agriculture 

decreased by 19% between 1990 and 2015. 

Furthermore, the emissions inventory indicates that 

levels of all these pollutants continued to decrease in 

2015, with the exception of ammonia and PM2.5. The 

most prominent examples of this are: 

• Emissions of sulphur dioxide further decreased by 

23% from 2015 compared to 2014, dropping to the 

lowest level so far since 1970. 

• Emissions of nitrogen oxides decreased in 2015 

compared to 2014 by 4.0%, dropping to the lowest level 

so far since 1970. 

The trajectories of emissions levels for each of the key 

pollutants for the UK, in each year since 1970, based on 

the data that are available, are set out in the attached 

graph. 

The Answer includes the following attached material: 

Long Term Emissions Trends (1970-2015) [HL6317 - Long Term 

Emissions Trends (1970-2015).pdf]

answers-statements/written-question/Lords/2017-03-27/HL6317 

Air Pollution: Urban Areas 

Asked by Lord Hunt of Chesterton 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment 

they have made of the accuracy of local air pollution 

forecasts in major cities; and what comparisons they 

make between these forecasts and those provided by 

other organisations. [I] [HL6318] 

Lord Gardiner of Kimble: Defra publishes the daily 

air pollution forecast provided by the Met Office on the 

UK Air website. A 2013 Defra-commissioned study made 

a comparison of the Met Office air quality forecasting 

model against three other models over a six month period. 

This found that the Met Office model generally performed 

best overall in both urban and rural areas. 

The Met Office has built a system for acquiring air 

quality observations from the Automatic Urban and Rural 

Network and comparing its air quality forecast against 

these observations, in order to evaluate and verify 

performance of the forecast system. In addition, a recent 

development of the system allows a comparison against 

the EU Copernicus forecasting system. This evaluation 

runs on a daily basis, to inform forecasters about current 

and recent forecast performance; and on a longer 

timescale, to identify areas requiring further research. 

Basil al-Araj 

Asked by Baroness Tonge 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what 

representations they are making to the government of 

Israel regarding the killing of the activist Basil al-Araj. 

[HL6187] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: We have not raised this 

issue with the Israeli authorities. 

Bovine Tuberculosis 

Asked by Baroness Parminter 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, in the light of the 

recent outbreak of bovine tuberculosis in hounds, what 

assessment they have made of the risk of future 

outbreaks; and what steps they are taking to prevent 

future outbreaks. [HL6338] 

Lord Gardiner of Kimble: TB in dogs caused by 

Mycobacterium bovis, the bovine TB bacterium, is 

extremely rare. Dogs pose a very low risk of transmitting

the disease to cattle herds and, overall, they play an 

insignificant role in the persistence of bovine TB in 

England. 

Defra’s Chief Veterinary Officer met the Chairman of 

the Master of Fox Hounds Association and others on 8 

February. The discussion included possible new best 

practice guidance that would reduce the risk of infection 

in hounds. 

Burma: Human Rights 

Asked by Lord Alton of Liverpool 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what is their 

response to the Interim Report and recommendations of 

the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State; and what 

representations they will make to the government of 

Burma regarding the implementation of those 

recommendations. [HL6157] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: We welcome the 

Rakhine Advisory Commission’s interim 

recommendations. The Minister for Asia and the Pacific 

expressed this directly to former UN Secretary General 

Kofi Annan, Chair of the Commission, on 16 March. The 

recommendations represent an important step in resolving 

the long-standing issues in Rakhine State and we 

welcome the Burmese Government’s endorsement of 

them. The UK stands ready to provide support to the 

Burmese Government in implementing the 

recommendations. 

Business Appointments Advisory Committee 

Asked by Lord Myners 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government whether they will 

review the effectiveness of the Advisory Committee on 

Business Appointments. [HL6215] 

Lord Young of Cookham: The Government believes 

that the independent Advisory Committee on Business 

Appointments discharges its remit effectively and 

efficiently. 

Cameroon: Human Rights 

Asked by Baroness Northover 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what 

representations they have made to the government of 

Cameroon concerning reports of the suspension of 

internet and email services in the English-speaking 

regions of that country and alleged government 

repression of the Anglophone minority. [HL6173] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: We continue to raise the 

shutdown of the internet in certain areas with the 

Government of Cameroon. 

We have called for the Cameroon authorities to allow 

everyone to voice their concerns peacefully and without 

hindrance, restore access to the internet, and for the 

Government and those in the English speaking regions to 

come to a peaceful resolution. 

CH2M Hill 

Asked by Lord Berkeley 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

Written Answers by Lord Gardiner of Kimble on 16 

March (HL5813 and HL5815), since HS2 Ltd, Thames 

Water Utilities Ltd and Bazalgette Tunnel Ltd are all 

private limited companies, why the information 

requested is available for HS2 but not the other 

companies. [HL6301] 

Lord Gardiner of Kimble: HS2 Ltd is funded by the 

Government, whereas Bazalgette Tunnel Ltd and Thames 

Water Utilities Ltd are not, and as such, different 

arrangements apply in respect of the information which 

the Government can request from them and the extent to 

which it can be disclosed. 

In the particular case of information about CH2M Hill 

staff referred to in the noble Lord’s previous question 

(HL5813), this is not required by the Secretary of State to 

carry out her functions, and Defra therefore does not hold 

it. 

Child Tax Credit 

Asked by Baroness Drake 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment 

they have made of the number of families that would be 

affected, over the next five years, by the Child Tax 

Credits (Amendment) Regulations 2017 whereby a 

child or qualifying young person born before 6 April 

2017 who is taken into a household as a result of a 

kinship care arrangement, will not be disregarded for 

the purposes of the two child limit if the claimant or 

joint claimants subsequently have a third child of their 

own born on or after 6 April 2017; and what is the 

anticipated saving to the public purse of such a change. 

[HL6205] 

Baroness Neville-Rolfe: From 6 April 2017 families 

will no longer be able to claim additional support of up to 

£2,780 per child per year for third and subsequent 

children born on or after this date through Child Tax 

Credit or Universal Credit. All households should think 

carefully about whether they are financially prepared to 

support a new child without relying on means-tested 

benefits. 

There will be no cash losers as a result of the 

Government’s policy to limit support to two children in 

Child Tax Credit and Universal Credit. 

We recognise that some claimants are not able to make 

the same choices as others about the number of children 

in their family. We have been clear that for third and 

subsequent children there will be exceptions for certain 

groups.

The forecast savings from the policy to limit support to 

two children in Child Tax Credit and Universal Credit 

were updated at the Spring Budget 2017. The cost to the 

public purse of the exceptions were also outlined in the 

Spring Budget 2017. 

Convention for the Safeguarding of the 

Intangible Cultural Heritage 

Asked by Lord Black of Brentwood 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government why they have not 

ratified the UNESCO Convention on the Safeguarding 

of Intangible Cultural Heritage. [HL6360] 

Lord Ashton of Hyde: It is necessary to carefully 

prioritise resources towards those Conventions that will 

have the most impact on the safeguarding of our heritage, 

such as the recent final steps taken towards ratification of 

the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural 

Property. However, the Government fully recognises the 

contribution that the UK’s oral traditions, social practices 

and festive events make to the country’s cultural fabric, 

and continues to encourage communities to celebrate 

these practices and to continue them for future 

generations. A particularly notable example of research 

into this area has recently been undertaken by Museums 

Galleries Scotland, as their project to record and map the 

intangible cultural heritage of Scotland has identified an 

impressive breadth and variety of practices. 

Corporate Manslaughter: Prosecutions 

Asked by Lord Knight of Weymouth 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

Written Answer by Lord Keen of Elie on 9 March 

(HL5640), whether the legal guidance for prosecutors 

concerning the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate 

Homicide Act 2007, as set out on the Crown 

Prosecution Service’s website at 14 March, is current; 

and whether the Special Crime Unit in the Special 

Crime and Counter Terrorism Division, CPS 

Headquarters, continues to maintain an overview of 

corporate manslaughter cases, as set out in the 

penultimate paragraph of that advice. [HL6293] 

Lord Keen of Elie: The Crown Prosecution Service’s 

publicly available legal guidance concerning corporate 

manslaughter accurately reflects the CPS’s policy on 

prosecuting for this offence. The guidance includes a 

requirement for cases to which the guidance may 

ultimately apply to be referred to the Special Crime Unit 

of the Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Division. 

Electoral Register 

Asked by Lord Bird 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what steps they 

intend to take to assist electors without a permanent 

address to register to vote, including registering online; 

and whether any forthcoming review of electoral law 

will address and include measures to reduce the 

proportion of homeless and vulnerably housed electors 

who are not registered to vote. [HL6280] 

Lord Young of Cookham: We are committed to a 

democracy that works for everyone, including homeless 

people. The Minister for Constitution has gathered 

specific evidence on the registration barriers faced by 

homeless people as part of his Every Voice Matters tour. 

Specifically, the Minister for the Constitution met with 

homelessness organisations and their clients to hear how 

the electoral registration system could better respond to 

their needs. We will continue to work with homelessness 

charities, such as Shelter and others, to overcome barriers 

and help those with no fixed address to register to vote. 

Employment: Disability 

Asked by Lord Judd 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, following the 

Green Paper consultation  Improving Lives: Work, 

Health and Disability, what assessment they have made 

of the ability to work of some disabled people with 

complex needs; and what measures they are taking to 

support those people. [HL6165] 

Lord Henley: We are committed to understanding what 

works for people in the ESA Support Group, many of 

whom have complex needs, and announced in the Green 

Paper that we will undertake comprehensive research and 

develop a large scale trial to test and learn from different 

approaches of offering employment support to people in 

this group taking into consideration views and ideas 

gathered through the consultation, which closed on 17 th 

February. 

In the Green Paper, we also announced the details of the 

Personal Support Package. This package includes a broad 

spectrum of employment support, with specific provision 

made for the hardest to help Employment and Support 

Allowance (ESA) claimants placed in the work-related 

activity group (and Universal Credit equivalents). This 

comprises: 

• More places on the Specialist Employability Support 

(SES) programme; and 

• Trialling and testing new forms of employment 

support to continue to build our evidence base for the 

hardest to help, including: 

i) Testing a jobcentre-led alternative to the SES 

programme; 

ii) Testing locally delivered Supported Employment; 

and 

iii) Testing the use of Supported Work Experience for 

young people. 

Entry Clearances: India

Exports 

Asked by Baroness Quin 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

answer by Baroness Mobarik on 24 January (HL Deb, 

col 550) concerning UK exports, what criteria the 

Department for International Trade uses in deciding 

which markets and sectors to target through its export 

campaigns. [HL6174] 

Lord Price: No set criteria are used in deciding which 

market-sectors should be export campaigns. Instead a 

range of different factors determine the campaigns. 

Primarily, we consider the ability of Government to add 

value to UK exports as recorded by the ONS. This is 

judged over a five-year forecasting period. We also 

consider the diversification across sectors and markets to 

ensure the portfolio of export campaigns is balanced. It is 

a proven framework for analysing where Government 

interventions can add the most value for the benefit of the 

whole of the UK. 

Asked by Baroness Quin 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

answer by Baroness Mobarik on 24 January (HL Deb, 

col 550) concerning UK exports, what export 

campaigns are currently sponsored by the Department 

for International Trade, broken down by market and 

sector. [HL6175] 

Lord Price: It is the Department for International 

Trade’s policy not to disclose campaigns by market and 

sector. This is because many of the campaigns relate to 

specific commercial deals targeted by UK firms with 

Government support. Disclosing that information may put 

at risk the commercial deals they are pursuing. 

Fly-tipping 

Asked by Viscount Goschen 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how many 

instances of fly tipping have been reported in each of 

the past three financial years; and how many successful 

prosecutions have been brought over the same period. 

[HL6229] 

Lord Gardiner of Kimble: The number of instances of 

fly-tipping reported by local authorities, and the number 

of successful prosecutions brought over the last three 

years are set out in the table below. 

Financial  
year 

Number of  
Incidents 

Number of 
successful 

prosecutions 

2013/14 852,036 1,953 

2014/15 899,763 1,771 

2015/16 936,090 2,091 

The data is published on the GOV.UK website. 

The overall trend in fly-tipping incidents had shown a 

steady decline between 2007/08 and 2012/13 until 

2013/14 when there was an increase to 852,000 incidents. 

Prosecutions have been more variable, with a peak in 

2011/12. The 2015/16 figure is more average. 

Many local authorities have started to improve the way 

they capture and report fly-tips over the past few years, so 

the increase over time should be interpreted with some 

care. It has also been brought to our attention that the 

definitions used to describe fly-tips are interpreted 

broadly from the guidance. 

Former Ministers 

Asked by Lord Myners 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government whether the 

Advisory Committee on Business Appointments has 

ever advised a former minister not to accept an 

appointment. [HL6294] 

Lord Young of Cookham: The independent Advisory 

Committee on Business Appointments provides its advice 

direct to the former Minister in question. 

The Committee’s final advice is published online when 

an appointment has been taken up and/or publicly 

announced. Until this point, the process is confidential

Freedom of Expression 

Asked by Lord Vinson 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what steps they 

are taking, through instruction to the appropriate 

authorities and through the dissemination of guidance, 

to clarify their position concerning the right to insult as 

an element of freedom of speech. [HL6273] 

Baroness Williams of Trafford: Guidance on the 

Public Order Act 1986 was published by the College of 

Policing in December 2013. This supplements guidance 

produced by the College of Policing on Public Order 

issues which was published in October 2013. Crown 

Prosecution Service guidance on public order offences 

was published in May 2013. 

Gambling: Children 

Asked by The Lord Bishop of St Albans 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, in the light of the 

position paper published by the Gambling Commission 

in March concerning online gambling using virtual in-

game currencies, whether they will take further steps to 

protect children from being exposed to such gambling. 

[HL6429] 

Lord Ashton of Hyde: Where online gambling using 

virtual in-game currencies is offered to British consumers 

located in Britain, a Gambling Commission license is 

required and licensing requirements to protect children 

and the vulnerable must be met including measures to 

prevent underage gambling. 

The Gambling Commission has a range of enforcement 

powers available. In February 2017, following a 

prosecution brought by the Gambling Commission, two 

Directors of Game Gold Tradings Limited, a company 

which operated as FutGalaxy.com (an unlicensed 

gambling website) entered guilty pleas to offences under 

the Gambling Act 2005. 

The Government keeps this issue under review will not 

hesitate to take action if it is needed to protect young 

people from gambling-related harm. 

Asked by The Lord Bishop of St Albans 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, in the light of the 

position paper by the Gambling Commission published 

in March drawing attention to the risk of users of social 

casino games transitioning to real money gambling, 

whether they will take steps to restrict children’s access 

to social casino games. [HL6430] 

Lord Ashton of Hyde: Social gaming is already 

covered by existing consumer protection legislation and 

other regulatory bodies. Evidence of the transition from 

social games to real money gambling is limited, however 

the Gambling Commission continue to monitor 

participation in social casino games. The Gambling 

Commission position paper, published in March 2017, 

concluded that there is not a persuasive case to pursue 

further regulatory intervention in social gaming. 

The Government expects the social casino industry to 

adopt a socially responsible approach and awareness of 

potential harm. 

Government will not hesitate to take action if it is 

needed to protect young people from gambling-related 

harm. 

Government Departments: Procurement 

Asked by Viscount Waverley 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government which government 

departments are responsible for their own procurement. 

[HL6390] 

Lord Young of Cookham: All central government 

departments are responsible for their own procurement. 

The Crown Commercial Service (CCS) provides a 

range of commercial services to the public sector to 

enable departments to achieve best value for money from 

their procurement. 

Asked by Viscount Waverley 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government from which 

professional bodies the civil service seeks support to 

discharge procurement responsibilities, broken down by 

department. [HL6391] 

Lord Young of Cookham: HM Government works 

with a number of professional bodies to discharge its 

procurement and commercial activities, principally the 

Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS) 

and the International Association for Contract and 

Commercial Management (IACCM). 

A detailed breakdown of departments’ dealings with 

these organisations is not held centrally. 

Home Office: Correspondence 

Asked by Baroness Cox 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government when they intend 

to reply to a letter from the European Centre for the 

Study of Extremism sent on 27 February about requests 

for UK visas for Syrian officials. [HL6203] 

Baroness Williams of Trafford: The Home Office is 

not aware of any correspondence from the European 

Centre for the Study of Extremism. 

Horses: Animal Welfare 

Asked by Lord De Mauley 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government when they expect 

to publish the new Code of Practice for the keeping of 

equines. [I] [HL6413] 

Lord Gardiner of Kimble: We are currently aiming to 

lay the updated statutory Code of Practice for the Welfare 

of Horses, Ponies, Donkeys and Their Hybrids before 

Parliament before the end of the year.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Equine

Human Rights: Republic of Ireland 

Asked by Lord Laird 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment 

they have made of the extent to which the government 

of the Republic of Ireland ensures an equivalent level of 

protection for human rights in Ireland to that 

established in Northern Ireland by the Belfast 

Agreement 1998; and if not, what actions they propose. 

[HL6353] 

Lord Dunlop: The Belfast Agreement commits the 

Irish Government to ensuring an equivalent level of 

protection for human rights in Ireland to that established 

in Northern Ireland by the Agreement. 

As a result of this commitment, the Irish Government 

established the Irish Human Rights Commission, which in 

November 2014 merged with the Equality Authority to 

form the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. 

The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, like 

the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, is a UN 

‘A status’ accredited National Human Rights Institution, 

structured and operated in accordance with the Paris 

Principles. 

The commitment to ensure an equivalent level of 

protection for human rights in Ireland to that established 

in Northern Ireland is a matter for the Irish Government. 

Asked by Lord Laird 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

Written Answer by Lord Dunlop on 13 March 

(HL5767), what issues of human rights in the Irish 

Republic they have discussed with the government of 

the Republic of Ireland since 1998, and what was the 

outcome of those discussions. [HL6355] 

Lord Dunlop: The Government has regular meetings 

with Ministers from the Irish Government. 

These discussions cover a wide range of issues which 

are relevant to the situation in Northern Ireland including 

on human rights. 

Immigrants: Detainees 

Asked by Baroness Lister of Burtersett 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what progress 

they have made in introducing detention reviews for 

those held in immigration removal centres. [HL6236] 

Baroness Williams of Trafford: Any individual 

detained within immigration detention is already subject 

to regular review, both on a scheduled basis and whenever 

there is any change in circumstances that might be 

material to the decision on whether or not to continue 

detention. Reviews are carried out at successively more 

senior levels the longer the detention continues. 

Following publication of the Government’s response to 

Stephen Shaw’s Report into the welfare in detention of 

vulnerable persons on 14 January 2016, work has been 

ongoing to design a more effective case management 

process to replace the existing procedure for reviewing 

detention. This includes a more proactive approach to the 

review of detention, through Case Progression Plans 

which show the monitoring and review of ongoing 

detention and with a focus on return or, if appropriate, 

release. Case Progression Plans are currently being 

piloted across the Home Office and are subject to 

evaluation. 

Asked by Lord Scriven 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what discussions 

they have had with civil society organisations regarding 

community-based alternatives to immigration detention 

centres. [HL6243] 

Baroness Williams of Trafford: The Home Office 

engages with civil society organisations at official and 

Ministerial level on a regular basis as part of the 

development of policy. 

Immigration Bail 

Asked by Baroness Lister of Burtersett 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government when they intend 

to introduce automatic bail hearings under Schedule 10 

to the Immigration Act 2016. [HL6237] 

Baroness Williams of Trafford: We are currently 

working with the Ministry of Justice, Her Majesty’s Court 

Service and the First-tier Tribunal to implement the 

Secretary of State’s duty to introduce automatic bail 

hearings, as set out in paragraph 11 of Schedule 10 to the 

Immigration Act 2016. This is one of a number of reforms 

necessary to implement the wider immigration bail 

provisions in Schedule 10 and it will be commenced 

alongside those other provisions in due course. 

Irish Language 

Asked by Lord Laird 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, in the light of the 

parity of esteem under the 1998 Belfast Agreement, 

whether any change of status for the Irish language 

would also be granted to the Ulster Scots language. 

[HL6255] 

Lord Dunlop: Although the recent talks have not yet 

delivered a devolved power-sharing Executive in 

Northern Ireland, the Government’s priority is to see a 

functioning Executive in place at Stormont. 

Under the devolution settlement, the majority of 

responsibility for language issues rests with the Northern 

Ireland Executive, including policy relating to the 

promotion of minority languages.

Israel: Bedouin 

Asked by Lord Hylton 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

Written Answer by Baroness Anelay of St Johns on 14 

March (HL5738), what response was received when the 

Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the Foreign 

and Commonwealth Office raised the issue of the 

possible demolition of houses and the village school of 

Al Khan al Ahmar in the Occupied Palestinian 

Territories with the Israeli Ambassador to the UK on 1 

March. [HL6267] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: The Israeli Ambassador 

said no action could be taken to demolish Khan Al Ahmar 

without following due process and endeavoured to raise 

the issue with his Government. The Foreign Secretary 

also raised the UK’s grave concerns about demolitions, 

including the village of Khan Al Ahmar, with Prime 

Minister Netanyahu during his visit to Israel on 8 March. 

Israel: Palestinians 

Asked by Baroness Tonge 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what 

representations they have made to the government of 

Israel concerning reports that Palestinian children living 

in the occupied West Bank and Gaza needing hospital 

treatment outside Gaza cannot be accompanied by a 

parent unless that parent is aged 55 or older or is subject 

to a security check. [HL6186] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: While we have not 

raised this specific issue, we have consistently urged the 

Israeli Government to ease movement and access 

restrictions in the Occupied Palestinian Territories 

(OPTs), most recently on 13 March. We are also 

supporting the UN Access Coordination Unit to work 

with the Israeli Government, Palestinian Authority and 

aid agencies to help facilitate humanitarian access in the 

OPTs. 

Asked by Baroness Tonge 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what discussions 

they have had at the UN regarding the report by the UN 

Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia 

which stated that Israel practises apartheid against 

Palestine. [HL6219] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: The UK does not 

endorse the Economic and Social Commission for 

Western Asia report. The British Government has not 

engaged the UN in discussions about the report, and it has 

been withdrawn by the UN. 

The situation on the ground demonstrates the urgent 

need to make progress towards peace. The UK remains 

committed to the two-state solution as the best way to 

bring peace and stability to the region. 

Asked by Baroness Tonge 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, in the light of 

reports of the shooting of Ibrahim Mahmoud Matar by 

the Israeli police on 13 March, what representations 

they are making to the government of Israel regarding 

the killing of Palestinian suspects who have already 

been detained. [HL6220] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: We have not raised this 

issue with Israeli authorities. 

Asked by Baroness Tonge 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government whether they have 

received reports of tear gas and rubber bullets being 

used in schools in Abu Dis in March. [HL6221] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: Yes, we have received a 

report on this issue from our Consulate-General in 

Jerusalem. 

Asked by Baroness Tonge 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what recent 

representations they have made to the government of 

Israel about the treatment of Palestinian child prisoners; 

and what assessment they have made of whether that 

treatment has improved during the last year. [HL6222] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: The Minister for the 

Middle East and Africa raised this issue with the Israeli 

Ambassador to London on 1 March. Officials from our 

Embassy in Tel Aviv also regularly raised this issue with 

the Israeli authorities, most recently on 9 March 2017. We 

welcomed progress made in recent Israeli policy 

amendments. 

However, the UK continues to have strong concerns 

about continued reports of ill-treatment of Palestinian 

minors. Embassy officials meet with the Israeli authorities 

on a regular basis to advocate for the end of night-time 

arrests and summons, consistent access to lawyers and 

parents for all minors, and implementation of other 

protection measures. 

Lebanon and Tunisia: Travel Information 

Asked by Lord Hylton 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government when they will 

review their travel advice for (1) Tunisia, and (2) 

Lebanon, in the light of the economic development and 

democratic progress made by those countries; and what 

assessment they have made of the appropriateness of 

issuing blanket guidance for the whole of each country. 

[HL6231] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: Travel advice is kept 

under constant review. Risk to British nationals is our 

foremost consideration. The advice for each country is 

varied to reflect local conditions: there are two categories

Morton Hall Immigration Removal Centre 

Asked by Lord Alton of Liverpool 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment 

they have made of the  Report on an unannounced 

inspection of Morton Hall Immigration Removal Centre  

by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, published on 21 

March. [HL6209] 

Asked by Lord Alton of Liverpool 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what is their 

response to the findings of the  Report on an 

unannounced inspection of Morton Hall Immigration 

Removal Centre  by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, 

published on 21 March, in particular that (1) too many 

detainees were held for prolonged periods, (2) the 

average length of detention was high, (3) children were 

detained for long periods of time due to failures in age 

assessment processes, (4) in one case, an incorrect 

Home Office age assessment led to the detention of a 

child for 36 days before social services confirmed that 

the boy was 16 years old, (5) the adults at risk policy 

was not yet widely understood, (6) there had been a 

three-fold increase in incidents of self-harm since the 

previous inspection, (7) the causes of self-harm had not 

been sufficiently analysed and there was no strategy to 

reduce it, and (8) four detainees had narrowly escaped 

fatal or serious injuries as a result of self-harm during 

the previous year. [HL6210] 

Baroness Williams of Trafford: The Government 

takes the welfare of detainees extremely seriously and has 

carefully considered the HM Chief Inspector of Prison’s 

(HMCIP) report on Morton Hall immigration removal 

centre. The service improvement plan will be published 

on the HMCIP website shortly. 

We will closely monitor progress towards 

implementing these recommendations. Stephen Shaw 

CBE has been invited to carry out a short review later this 

year to assess progress against his previous review into 

the welfare in detention of vulnerable persons. 

Asked by Baroness Lister of Burtersett 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, in the light of the  

Report on an unannounced inspection of Morton Hall

of Prisons, published on 21 March, what assessment 

they have made of the reasons for children being 

detained at the centre for (1) 12 days, (2) 36 days, and 

(3) 151 days, during the last year. [HL6234] 

Baroness Williams of Trafford: The Home Office 

does not comment on individual cases. 

The Home Office policy is not to detain children. 

Where there is doubt as to the age of an individual. 

Immigration Enforcement will detain individuals who 

claim to be a child (under 18) until they are referred to a 

local authority for a Morton-compliant age assessment. 

Individuals who frustrate the age assessment and 

identification process may incur a lengthened period of 

detention. All three individuals were later identified as 

children and released into the custody of local authorities. 

The Government will respond to HM Chief Inspector of 

Prisons Report on the unannounced inspection of Morton 

Hall immigration Removal Centre in due course. 

Asked by Baroness Lister of Burtersett 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, in the light of the

taking to reduce the length of time individuals are 

detained; and whether they plan to introduce a 

maximum length of detention. [HL6235] 

Baroness Williams of Trafford: It is already the case 

that individuals detained under Immigration Act powers 

are held for the minimum time necessary to achieve their 

removal from the United Kingdom.  

As part of the Government’s response to the review of 

the welfare in detention of vulnerable persons undertaken 

by Stephen Shaw CBE the Home Office has introduced, 

or is planning to introduce, a range of measure designed 

to further minimise the length of time individuals spend in 

immigration detention. These measures include: a new 

internal detention gatekeeper function to monitor 

admissions to the detention estate; new case progression 

plans with a clear focus on the individual’s removal from 

the UK; and quarterly internal case progression panels to 

monitor progression of all detained cases and reduce the 

number of long-term detainees. 

The Government has no plans to introduce a maximum 

time limit on immigration detention.

Asked by Lord Scriven 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, in the light of the  

Report on an unannounced inspection of Morton Hall 

Immigration Removal Centre  by HM Chief Inspector 

of Prisons, published on 21 March, what steps they are 

taking to ensure that staff in immigration detention 

centres understand and apply their guidance on adults at 

risk in immigration detention. [HL6244] 

Baroness Williams of Trafford: A training 

presentation pack on Detention Services Order (DSO) on 

the care and management of adults at risk in the detention 

estate (08/2016) was circulated to all Home Office 

Immigration Enforcement staff in the immigration 

detention estate, including staff at Morton Hall 

immigration removal centre (IRC) in September 2016. 

The final version of DSO 08/2016 was published on 27 

February 2017. Home Office business embedded trainers 

are delivering training on the DSO to staff in the IRCs, 

including supplier and healthcare staff. Staff at Morton 

Hall IRC received training in February and a refresher 

training session will be added to the annual training 

schedule for NOMS staff at the centre. 

Asked by Lord Scriven 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, with reference to 

the  Report on an unannounced inspection of Morton 

Hall Immigration Removal Centre  by HM Chief 

Inspector of Prisons, published on 21 March, what 

assessment they have made of the relationship between 

the absence of limits on the length of time an individual 

can be detained and the incidence of self-harm in 

immigration detention centres. [HL6245] 

Baroness Williams of Trafford: All incidents of self 

harm are treated very seriously and every step is taken to 

prevent incidents of this nature. Staff at all centres are 

trained to identify those at risk of self harm so that action 

can be taken to minimise the risk. Notices in various 

languages are displayed in IRCs setting out that where a 

detainee is concerned about a fellow detainee this should 

be brought to the attention of a member of staff. Formal 

risk assessments on initial detention and systems for 

raising concerns at any subsequent point feed into 

established self harm procedures in every IRC. These are 

in turn underpinned by the Home Office Operating 

Standard on the prevention of self-harm and detention 

services order 06/2008, Assessment Care in Detention 

Teamwork (ACDT). 

Asked by Lord Scriven 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government when (1) the 

Home Secretary, and (2) the Immigration Minister, last

Baroness Williams of Trafford: The Home Secretary 

and Home Office Ministers conduct visits, and host 

meetings, on the whole spectrum of Home Office 

business regularly. It is our policy not to provide details 

of such visits. 

Information on ministers’ meetings is released quarterly

Written Answers 3 April 2017 Page 11 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: Any credible threats 

against British nationals would be fully investigated by 

the relevant authorities. 

Northern Ireland Government 

Asked by Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government whether they have 

any plans to bring forward legislation to prevent a 

second Northern Ireland Assembly election this year if 

there is no agreement to form a new Executive. 

[HL6292] 

Lord Dunlop: The Government remains focused on re-

establishing an inclusive, devolved government that the 

overwhelming majority of the people in Northern Ireland 

want to see. Progress has been made in recent discussions 

which provide a basis for further intensive discussions to 

resolve outstanding issues. If these further talks are 

successful, it would be the Government’s intention 

quickly to bring forward legislation after the Easter recess 

to allow an Executive to be formed and avoid a second 

Assembly election. The Secretary of State for Northern 

Ireland will be keeping the situation under close review. 

Occupational Pensions: Tax Allowances 

Asked by Baroness Altmann 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

Written Answers by Lord O’Neill of Gatley on 19 

September 2016 (HL1586, HL1587 and HL1757), Lord 

Freud on 15 September 2016 (HL1588), and Lord 

Young of Cookham on 25 October 2016 (HL2186), 

what analysis they have undertaken to identify how 

many employees are saving into a workplace pension 

which denies them tax relief. [HL6194] 

Asked by Baroness Altmann 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what will be the 

effect on the pension provision for low-paid workers 

earning (1) between £10,000 and £11,000 a year from 

their employer, and (2) below £10,000 a year from one 

or more employers, of being put into a defined 

contribution workplace pension scheme which operates 

on a net pay basis. [HL6195] 

Asked by Baroness Altmann 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment 

they have made of the challenges faced by low earners 

whose employers use a net pay arrangement pension 

scheme which denies them the tax relief they would 

receive in a relief at source scheme. [HL6197] 

Baroness Neville-Rolfe: Tax relief is granted on 

contributions to all registered pension schemes, including 

workplace pensions. This relief can be provided for 

through two mechanisms: net pay or relief at source. 

Where a scheme operates the net pay mechanism, 

contributions are deducted from pay before any tax is 

applied. This approach applies to all members of the 

scheme including those earning (1) between £10,000 and 

£11,000 a year from their employer, and (2) below 

£10,000 a year from one or more employers. The pension 

provision would depend on these contributions as well as 

those made by the employer. 

The Government appreciates the impacts on low paid 

workers whose employers use a net pay arrangement 

pension scheme. However, it has not been possible to 

identify any straightforward or proportionate means to 

align the effects of the net pay and relief at source 

mechanisms more closely for this population. 

Asked by Baroness Altmann 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what plans they 

have to ensure that employers and workers are told that 

net pay arrangement pension schemes may be 

unsuitable for workers who earn below the personal tax 

threshold, and that they face paying more than 20 per 

cent extra for their pension than if they were in a relief 

at source scheme. [HL6196] 

Asked by Baroness Altmann 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what plans they 

have to ensure that employers and workers are informed 

that net pay arrangement pension schemes may be 

unsuitable for workers who earn below the personal tax 

threshold unless the employer or the scheme pays in the 

amount they would receive in tax relief on their behalf. 

[HL6198] 

Asked by Baroness Altmann 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what contact they 

have had with the Pensions Regulator during the past 

six months to ensure that the Regulator and the 

MasterTrust Assurance Framework take all necessary 

steps to ensure that workers earning below the personal 

tax threshold, and their employers, who are paying into 

net pay pension schemes under the auto-enrolment 

rules, are not disadvantaged by the loss of tax relief, 

and are properly informed of the personal impact of 

those schemes. [HL6199] 

Baroness Neville-Rolfe: The Government has regular 

discussions with the Pensions Regulator on a range of 

issues, including workplace pensions. 

Workplace pension schemes are chosen by employers 

and the Pensions Regulator (TPR) provides guidance on 

this in relation to automatic enrolment. The guidance 

covers the choice between net pay and relief at source 

schemes, and the implications of net pay schemes for 

employees who do not pay tax. It also points out that 

some schemes that use the net pay arrangement may have 

lower charges than schemes that operate relief at source. 

All employers, including public sector employers, are 

expected to follow TPR’s guidance about providing their 

employees with relevant information on the arrangements 

for tax relief.

PAYE 

Asked by Lord Triesman 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what is their 

estimate of the average per capita annual PAYE 

receipts in each of the last five years, broken down by 

electoral division in the 23 June 2016 referendum. 

[HL6192] 

Baroness Neville-Rolfe: Analysis of income tax 

liabilities by region is published in HM Revenue and 

Customs (HMRC) statistics table 3.15 – “Income and tax 

by Parliamentary Constituency”, which is available on the 

gov.uk website[i]. 

This liabilities table relates to income tax whether 

collected through PAYE or another mechanism (such as 

Self-Assessment). Furthermore, the liabilities table 

excludes Class 1 National Insurance Contributions which 

are collected through PAYE. 

HMRC does not hold information on all PAYE receipts 

broken down by parliamentary constituency.

Prisoners: Suicide 

Asked by The Lord Bishop of St Albans 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, in the light of the 

increasing annual number of self-inflicted deaths in 

prisons since 2012, what steps they are taking to reduce 

the number of such deaths. [HL6247] 

Lord Keen of Elie: We are clear that violence, self-

harm and deaths in our prisons are too high. The 

department has taken immediate action to stabilise the 

estate by tackling the drugs, drones and phones that 

undermine security and are also investing £100m annually 

to boost the frontline by 2,500 officers. These are long-

standing issues that will not be resolved in weeks or 

months but our wholesale reforms will lay the 

groundwork to transform our prisons, reduce reoffending 

and make our communities safer. We will carefully study 

the details of all deaths in custody to determine whether 

there are any patterns, or lessons to be learned, to further 

our understanding of why these tragic events happen. A 

range of measures will be put in place to help support 

prisoners who are at risk of self-harm or suicide, 

especially in the first 24 hours where prisoners are at their 

most vulnerable. We are also investing more in mental 

health awareness training for staff. 

Sheep Worrying 

Asked by Baroness Masham of Ilton 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what action they 

are taking to reduce the incidence of dogs worrying 

sheep. [HL6268] 

Lord Gardiner of Kimble: Defra and the Animal 

Health and Welfare Board for England (AHWBE) 

recently met police forces, farming and rural interests 

groups to discuss the situation. Under the auspices of the 

National Police Chiefs’ Council, five police forces are 

collaborating to pilot more systematic data collection of 

incidents and good response practices. 

Social Services: Finance 

Asked by Lord Warner 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

Written Answer by Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth on 28 

December 2016 (HL4037) and the variation in yield 

revealed, what assessment they have made of the 

implications of the variation in yields for the NHS 

locally; and whether they remain committed to social 

care precept increases as a basis for funding adult social 

care on a sustainable basis. [HL6251] 

Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth: No assessment has 

been made of the implication of the variation in yields for 

the NHS locally; this is a tax raised and managed by local 

government, to be spent on adult social care. Our policy 

on the social care precept has been set until 2019-20. No 

decision has been made about the policy after 2020. 

The government has taken several steps during this 

Parliament to help secure a strong and sustainable social 

care system, including an additional £2 billion of funding 

announced at Budget to support adult social care in the 

short term. Taken all together, councils have access to 

£9.25 billion more dedicated funding for social care over 

the next three years, as a result of measures introduced by 

the government since 2015. In the longer term, the 

government is committed to establishing a fair and more 

sustainable basis for adult social care, in the face of future 

demographic challenges, and proposals to put the system 

on a more secure and sustainable long term footing will 

be set out in a green paper. 

Sovereignty: Scotland 

Asked by Lord Alton of Liverpool 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what discussions 

they have held with the Scottish Government 

concerning the inclusion of a third option, offering 

further devolution of powers to Scotland, in any future 

Scottish independence referendum; what assessment 

they have made of the benefits of including such an 

option; and whether they have ruled out its inclusion.

Lord Dunlop: The Government is focused on our 

negotiations with the European Union and getting the 

right deal for Scotland and the whole of the United 

Kingdom. We have already committed that no decisions 

currently taken by the devolved administrations will be 

removed from them and we will use the opportunity of 

bringing decision making back to the UK to ensure that 

more decisions are devolved. 

Sudan: Chemical Weapons 

Asked by Lord Alton of Liverpool 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government whether they have 

supported the call by Amnesty International to 

investigate the alleged use of chemical weapons by the 

government of Sudan against the civilian population of 

that country; whether the Organization for the 

Prevention of Chemical Weapons is conducting an 

investigation, or plans to do so; and if not, what action 

they have taken in response. [HL6160] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: We and other states 

encouraged the Organisation for the Prohibition of 

Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to look into the serious 

allegations made by Amnesty International. The OPCW 

asked the Government of Sudan, as a State Party to the 

Chemical Weapons Convention, to share all relevant 

information, and offered its assistance in any 

investigation. The Sudanese authorities have since 

reported to the OPCW that their national investigations 

have found no evidence of chemical weapon use in the 

Jebel Marra region. We have had discussions with 

Amnesty representatives following their report and 

encouraged them to engage with the OPCW directly. We 

continue to press the government of Sudan to allow the 

AU/UN Peacekeeping Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) 

unrestricted humanitarian access to all parts of Darfur. 

Sudan: Organisation for the Prohibition of 

Chemical Weapons 

Asked by Lord Alton of Liverpool 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government whether they 

supported the appointment of a representative of the 

government of Sudan as Vice Chairman of the 

Organization for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons; 

and, in making this appointment, what account was 

taken of the allegations by Amnesty International that 

chemical weapons have been used against the civilian 

population of Sudan, and of the decision of the 

International Criminal Court to indict the President of 

Sudan on charges of genocide. [HL6158] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: Regional groupings of 

the States Parties to the Organisation for the Prohibition 

of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) designate candidates for 

the Chairmanship and four Vice-Chair positions, which 

are traditionally adopted by consensus within the 

Executive Council in accordance with established OPCW 

rules and practice. On this occasion, Sudan was the Africa 

Group’s chosen representative. Given that we understand 

that more information would be required for the OPCW to 

investigate further the allegations against Sudan and that 

the role of Vice-Chair does not have authority over any 

action by the OPCW to look into allegations of use, we 

did not object to the Africa Group’s nominee. This is a 

separate issue to the International Criminal Court (ICC) 

indictment of President Bashir. The UK remains a strong 

supporter of the ICC and we continue to make clear that 

we expect compliance with the arrest warrants for all 

those indicted. 

Syria: Internally Displaced People 

Asked by Lord Hylton 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment 

they have made of the conditions in which displaced 

persons in Idlib Province, Syria, are living. [HL6322] 

Lord Bates: There are an estimated 1.3 million people 

in need of humanitarian assistance in Idlib province, of 

which more than 900,000 are internally displaced persons. 

The greatest humanitarian needs are for health, protection, 

and early recovery and livelihoods services. Food 

insecurity affects around 710,000 people. There has been 

a decrease in hostilities following the 30 December 

ceasefire, although airstrikes continue to pose a 

significant risk to civilians. Despite ongoing insecurity, 

humanitarian organisations continue to respond to the 

needs of the affected population and provide lifesaving 

support. 

Syria: Military Intervention 

Asked by Lord Hylton 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

answer by Baroness Anelay of St Johns on 20 March 

(HL Deb 10), whether they will cease giving political 

and practical support to armed insurgent groups in Syria 

in the interests of promoting the expulsion of Daesh 

from that country. [HL6232] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: The UK supports the 

moderate opposition in Syria, which has repeatedly 

underlined its commitment to a negotiated political 

settlement in line with international agreements. We 

recognise that the brutality of the Syrian regime has been 

the primary driver of extremism and terrorism in Syria. In 

the long term, therefore, terrorism and extremism can 

only be sustainably defeated in Syria through a political 

transition. 

We provide certain groups in the moderate opposition 

with political and practical support so that they can stand 

up to both the tyranny of Asad and that of Daesh. This has 

included communications, medical and logistics 

equipment and equipment to protect against chemical 

weapons attacks. The UK does not provide weapons to 

anybody in Syria. We will maintain this support, while 

continually and rigorously assessing all recipients to

or human rights abuses. 

Universal Credit 

Asked by Baroness Lister of Burtersett 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what is the 

rationale for setting a single benefit cap earnings 

exception threshold in Universal Credit linked to the 

National Living Wage; and whether this will require 

under-25s receiving the lower National Minimum 

Wage, including young lone parents, to work a longer 

number of hours before qualifying for the exception. 

[HL6169] 

Lord Henley: A threshold linked to the national living 

wage ensures the work incentive provided by the benefit 

cap is maintained. The new threshold is consistent with 

the original intention of the earnings exception threshold 

by excepting from the cap any household that earns the 

monthly equivalent of working 16 hours per week at the 

highest minimum wage rate in force. 

The Government has fully considered the position of 

people who may have to work more than 16 hours to 

qualify for the exception. More information is in the 

impact assessment and equality analysis published with 

the Universal Credit (Benefit Cap Earnings Exception) 

Amendment Regulations 2017 (SI No: 2017/138). The 

Government also published a statement in response to 

comments made by the Social Security Advisory 

Committee on the amendments. 

These documents can be found on: the 

‘legislation.gov.uk’ website by searching for year 2017 

number 138

Yemen: Press Freedom 

Asked by Lord Hylton 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what 

representations they have made to the government of 

Saudi Arabia regarding enabling journalists to enter 

Yemen. [HL6233] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: This Government 

recognises the importance of free movement of journalists 

to cover issues of global importance. This must be 

balanced against security and safety considerations. The 

Government currently advises against all travel to Yemen. 

The Foreign Secretary last spoke to the Saudi Arabian 

Foreign Minister, Adel al Jubeir on 22 March and 

discussed the importance of finding progress towards a 

political settlement. 

Zimbabwe: Overseas Aid 

Asked by Lord Oates 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how much 

overseas development aid funding has been committed 

to Zimbabwe in each of the last ten years for which 

figures are available. [HL6271] 

Lord Bates: The amounts of UK official bilateral 

development assistance to Zimbabwe in the last ten years 

are set out below. The final figure for 2016 will be 

published in mid-2017.

Zimbabwe: Pensions 

Asked by Lord Goodlad 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what estimate they 

have made of the cost of making the necessary financial 

arrangements to enable the government of Zimbabwe to 

pay the pension arrears owing to those former members 

of HM Overseas Service who responded to the British 

Government's request that they remain in their posts 

after Southern Rhodesia became independent. [I] 

[HL6228] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: The Government 

understands the hardship that lack of pension payments 

causes to former service-people and their families. The 

British Ambassador to Zimbabwe raises pensions 

frequently with the Zimbabwean Government and has 

secured written confirmation that it will resume payments 

when the economic situation improves. However, we 

have not made an estimate of the cost as these payments 

are the responsibility of the Government of Zimbabwe as 

set out in the Lancaster House Agreement in 1979.
