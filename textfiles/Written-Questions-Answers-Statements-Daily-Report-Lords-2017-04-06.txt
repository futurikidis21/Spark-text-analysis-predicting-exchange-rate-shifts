Written Answers 
Thursday, 6 April 2017 

A1 

Asked by Lord Beith 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

answers by Viscount Younger of Leckie on 7 February 

(HL Deb, col 1592), and in the light of the comments 

by the Chief Executive of Highways England on 22 

March that they will be publishing their delivery plan 

update in June, whether they plan to review the 

timetable for the improvements to the A1 north of 

Morpeth. [HL6279] 

Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon: Highways England 

continues to investigate options to improve the benefits 

and reduce the costs of schemes. This follows the normal 

processes to achieve value for money for the tax-payer, 

which is required for all government spending on 

infrastructure projects. This work may involve refining 

the scope and design of schemes and more time may be 

needed to assess them. 

Highways England will update their Delivery Plan in 

June laying out the programme for the 2017-18 and they 

expect to deliver all of the required work. 

Accident and Emergency Departments: 

General Practitioners 

Asked by Baroness Redfern 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how many general 

practitioner surgeries are operating within A&E 

departments on a 24/7 basis. [HL6427] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: The information is not held 

centrally. There are several different models of co-located 

services; urgent care centres, walk-in centres, minor 

injuries units and other clinics, which exist across the 

National Health Service in England and NHS England 

and NHS Improvement are working with all systems to 

ensure there is streaming to primary care (and other 

specialities) from emergency departments as standard. 

The specific models implemented will vary depending on 

local circumstances. 

The 2017 spring Budget announced capital investment 

of £100 million for front door streaming at accident and 

emergency departments. This will help provide space for 

services to allow streaming, such as on-site general 

practice facilities, to which non-urgent patients can be 

directed to access more appropriate care quickly and 

safely. 

Advance Pricing Agreements 

Asked by Lord Harries of Pentregarth 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how many 

Advance Thin Capitalisation Agreements (1) were 

agreed, and (2) were in force, in (a) 2014–15, and (b) 

2015–16. [HL6348] 

Asked by Lord Harries of Pentregarth 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what was the 

average time to reach an Advance Thin Capitalisation 

Agreement in (1) 2014–15, and (2) 2015–16. [HL6349] 

Asked by Lord Harries of Pentregarth 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how long it took 

to agree 50 per cent of Advance Thin Capitalisation 

Agreements in (1) 2014–15, and (2) 2015–16. [HL6350] 

Baroness Neville-Rolfe: HM Revenue and Customs 

(HMRC) intends to publish Advanced Thin Capitalisation 

Agreement statistics in due course as part of a wider 

publication of data relating to HMRC’s work on 

collecting tax owed to the UK. 

Asked by Lord Harries of Pentregarth 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what was the total 

volume of intra-group loans (1) for which Advance 

Thin Capitalisation Agreements (ATCAs) applied, and 

(2) in relation to which new ATCAs came into force, in 

each year since 2010. [HL6351] 

Asked by Lord Harries of Pentregarth 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what was (1) the 

weighted average interest rate for intra-group loans 

under Advance Thin Capitalisation Agreements 

(ATCAs), and (2) the average level of taxable profits to 

which ATCA-related tax relief applied, in each year 

since 2010. [HL6352] 

Baroness Neville-Rolfe: HM Revenue and Customs 

does not hold this information in a form which allows it to 

be provided without incurring disproportionate cost. 

Air Pollution: Health Hazards 

Asked by Baroness Kennedy of Cradley 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment 

they have made of the effect of air pollutants in the 

home on people’s health. [HL6468] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: Indoor air is affected by outdoor 

air pollution and by indoor sources such as tobacco 

smoke, scented candles and other household products. 

Further research is needed into how people are exposed to 

different sources of household air pollution to quantify its 

effect on health. 

Asked by Baroness Kennedy of Cradley 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment 

they have made of the effect of poor ventilation on 

people’s health. [HL6469] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: Public Health England has 

made no assessment of the effect of poor ventilation on 

people’s health.

Asylum: LGBT People 

Asked by Lord Scriven 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how many people 

identified as LGBT were held in asylum detention 

centres for more than (1) one month, (2) two months, 

(3) six months, and (4) one year, over the last two 

years. [HL6481] 

Asked by Lord Scriven 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government in relation to those 

claiming asylum on the grounds of being LGBT, how 

many cases have not been determined after (1) one 

year, and (2) two years, from the date of the individual 

claiming asylum. [HL6482] 

Baroness Williams of Trafford: On 27 February 2017, 

the Home Office responded to an FOI request asking for 

information relating to detainees who identify as LGBT in 

the immigration detention estate. The FOI asked for 

information relating to detainees who identify as LGBT in 

the immigration detention estate. These questions 

concerns asylum seekers, who have been recorded as 

being LGBT, and the numbers held in detention and the 

time taken to determine their asylum claims. 

The data you have requested in relation to LGBT 

asylum seekers over the last 2 years is not readily 

available. The required information would only be 

recorded in the case notes sections within the Home 

Office database or held solely on the paper files. The time 

required to examine individual cases and extrapolate the 

required data would exceed the cost limit. 

We are currently reviewing how and when to publish 

information on LGBT asylum claims though no decision 

has yet been taken regarding either a final timetable or the 

methodology of any such release. 

Bosnia and Herzegovina: EU Enlargement 

Asked by The Earl of Dundee 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what advice they 

are giving to give Bosnia and Herzegovina to prepare 

for its acceptance as a candidate country to join the EU. 

[HL6297] 

Asked by The Earl of Dundee 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment 

they have made of any issues holding back the 

acceptance of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a candidate 

country to join the EU, including relating to 

constitutional and legal reform; and what assistance 

they are giving as a result. [HL6298] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: The Government 

remains committed to driving reform, embedding stability 

and addressing shared challenges, such as security and 

migration, in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). At the 20 

September 2016 General Affairs Council, the EU agreed 

that the Commission should issue a questionnaire to BiH 

authorities to assess the country's readiness to be granted 

candidate country status. That process is continuing. We 

will continue to support the reforms required through our 

bilateral engagement (including approximately £6.63 

million in programme assistance in financial year 2016-

17), in order to ensure BiH becomes a more stable, secure 

and prosperous country. 

Bulgaria: Deportation 

Asked by Lord Hylton 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government whether they are 

making representations to the government of Bulgaria 

about the forced return of refugee children to 

Afghanistan. [HL6266] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: Her Majesty's 

Government has not made any such representations to the 

Government of Bulgaria. 

Chemicals: Health Hazards 

Asked by Baroness Kennedy of Cradley 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment 

they have made of the effect of (1) limonene, and (2) 

pinene, on people’s health. [HL6470] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: The chemicals used in air 

fresheners such as limonene and pinene are regulated 

under consumer product safety legislation and as long as 

the products are used as recommended by the 

manufacturers and under adequate ventilation conditions, 

they are unlikely to cause adverse health effects. 

Children: Poverty 

Asked by The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what is their 

estimate of the impact of the recent increase in inflation 

on the number of children in poverty; and what plans 

they have for protecting low income families against 

the rising cost of basic essentials. [HL6396] 

Lord Henley: Impacts of the latest increase in inflation 

on families with children have not been estimated. 

However the Department’s latest Households Below 

Average Income statistics to 2016 published on 16th 

March 2017 does show how the number of children in 

low income households has changed with reference to 

inflation (the measure is called absolute low income). 

Since 2010, there has been a decrease of 200,000 children 

before housing costs (BHC) in absolute low income. After 

housing costs (AHC) had been taken into account, there 

were 100,000 fewer children in absolute low income since 

2010. 

In terms of proportions, there have also been reductions 

in the rates of absolute low income on both bases - BHC

percentage point since 2010. 

Citizenship: Education 

Asked by Lord Blunkett 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what national or 

local (1) organisations, and (2) agencies, have been 

funded in the last 12 months in respect of the promotion 

of British values and associated work; and what 

guidance has been given to the Office for Standards in 

Education in relation to (a) inspection reporting on 

citizenship, British values and character building, as 

part of the national curriculum, and (b) the judgements 

made on the quality of education in both primary and 

secondary schools. [HL6392] 

Baroness Williams of Trafford: The Home Office’s 

Building a Stronger Britain Together (BSBT) Programme 

was established in early 2016 to deliver Pillars 1 and 2 of 

the Government’s Counter Extremism Strategy 

(countering extremist ideology, and building a partnership 

with those opposed to extremism). The Programme is 

designed to fulfil the Government’s commitment to 

‘develop a new network, linking individuals and groups 

around Britain who are already standing up to extremists 

in their communities’. Its objectives include reducing the 

number of people holding attitudes, beliefs and feelings 

that oppose shared values; an increased sense of 

belonging and civic participation at a local level; and 

more resilient communities. 

Fifty-three groups have been awarded support from the 

first round of applications under BSBT. The Home Office 

will announce the groups and publish details of the 

projects it is supporting shortly. 

DfE and the Home Office are jointly funding 

Breakthrough Media to manage the Educate Against Hate 

website, which aims to provide teachers, school leaders 

and parents with the information, guidance and support 

they need to challenge radical views and keep their 

children safe, including supporting the promotion of 

fundamental British values. 

In 27 January 2017, the Department for Education 

awarded a contract to the Association of Citizenship 

teaching to produce 6 resource packs to include high 

quality guidance for teachers to hold knowledge-based 

debates on topical issues relating to fundamental British 

values (democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, 

mutual respect for and tolerance of those with different 

beliefs and those without faith), citizenship and equality. 

The general reporting areas for school inspection are set 

out in section 5 of the Education Act 2005. Within this 

context, HM Chief Inspector is responsible for Ofsted’s 

common inspection framework and school inspection 

handbook, which set out how inspectors consider and 

report on these matters. In developing the framework and 

handbook, the Chief Inspector takes account of 

Departmental guidance to schools. This includes guidance 

on schools’ promotion of fundamental British values. 

Department of Health: ICT 

Asked by Baroness Wheeler 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what progress has 

been made on the Data Services Platform which is 

being developed by the Department of Health's arm's-

length bodies to standardise the collection of health and 

social care performance and costing data. [HL6443] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: The delivery of the Data 

Services Platform (DSP) is on-going as part of NHS 

Digital’s Personalised Health and Care 2020 Programme. 

The business case for the DSP is currently being finalised 

and NHS Digital are expected to seek approval for this 

shortly. 

Doctors and Nurses: Migrant Workers 

Asked by Lord Cooper of Windrush 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what is the total 

number of nurses employed within the NHS in England 

who are citizens of other EU countries and have 

resigned from their posts since 24 June 2016. [HL6463] 

Asked by Lord Cooper of Windrush 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what is the total 

number of (1) hospital doctors and consultants, and (2) 

general practitioners, employed within the NHS in 

England who are citizens of other EU countries and 

have resigned from their posts since 24 June 2016. 

[HL6464] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: The information is not 

available. NHS Digital can provide estimates of numbers 

leaving the National Health Service in England in the 

Hospital and Community Health Service by nationality, 

but cannot readily identify the reasons for leaving, such as 

resignation. General practitioners’ country of Primary 

Medical Qualification can be identified, but further details 

by nationality are not available. 

Entry Clearances: India 

Asked by Lord Green of Deddington 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government for what periods 

in 2009 and 2010 did the then UK Border Agency stop 

accepting new applications for a Tier 4 (General) 

student visa in North India. [HL6312] 

Baroness Williams of Trafford: The UK Border 

Agency stopped accepting Tier 4 applications from North 

India in February 2010 owing to concerns about 

fraudulent applications. The rules on the policy were 

strengthened during 2010 and the acceptance of 

applications resumed in August of that year. 

Asked by Lord Green of Deddington 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how many 

applications for a Tier 4 (General) student visa from 

Indian nationals were refused in each year from 2006 to

2016; what was the rate of refusal; how many appeals 

were lodged against refusals; and what number were 

subsequently allowed. [HL6314] 

Baroness Williams of Trafford: Quarterly information 

on the total number of Tier 4 (General) student visas 

refused is published in Visa table vi_01_q, and the total 

number of Indian nationals refused a visa (all categories) 

in table vi_02_q. The latest data are in the Home Office’s

Environment Protection 

Asked by Baroness Jones of Whitchurch 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what steps they 

have taken to establish clear objectives for all aspects of 

future environmental protection in the UK; and when 

those objectives will be published. [HL6614] 

Lord Gardiner of Kimble: We are committed to being 

the first generation to leave the environment in a better 

state than we found it. We will publish a 25 year 

environment plan during this Parliament to support that 

ambition. It will build on our long history of 

environmental protection, and set out our future approach 

to managing the environment. 

Fisheries Convention 

Asked by Baroness Byford 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

Written Answers by Lord Gardiner of Kimble on 9 

March (HL5592 and HL5593), and in the light of the 

invoking of Article 50 on 29 March, whether they 

intend to withdraw from the 1964 London Fisheries 

Convention, so that the rights of other states covered by 

that convention to fish in the 6–12 nautical mile zone 

are brought into line with the rights of non-convention 

EU member states following Brexit. [HL6461] 

Lord Gardiner of Kimble: We are looking very 

carefully at the London Fisheries Convention and at what 

action needs to be taken. As the Prime Minister told the 

House of Commons on 29 March, we hope to be able to 

say something about this soon. 

Fly-tipping 

Asked by Baroness Byford 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

answer by the Earl of Courtown on 8 March (HL Deb, 

col 1357), whether they will give further consideration 

to providing compensation to landowners in relation to 

large-scale commercial dumping of waste on private 

land. [I] [HL6460] 

Lord Gardiner of Kimble: The Government is not 

currently considering providing compensation to 

landowners in relation to large-scale commercial dumping 

of waste on private land. 

Fly-tipping is unacceptable whether it occurs on public 

or private land. However, fly-tipping on private land is a 

difficult issue. Local authorities are not under any legal 

obligation to clear fly-tipped waste from private property, 

so this responsibility falls to the landowner. Some 

authorities may offer a clearance service but they are 

likely to charge for this. If, following an investigation, a 

conviction is secured then the court can award 

compensation which covers the costs of clearance of 

waste to the landowner. 

Foreign Investment in UK 

Asked by Baroness Hayter of Kentish Town 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, in the light of the 

UK's exit from the EU, whether they are planning to 

introduce primary legislation dealing with foreign 

investment in UK companies. [HL6289] 

Lord Price: Until the UK leaves the EU, we will 

remain subject to EU trade and investment agreements 

and policy. We will in due course consider all options in 

the design of future bilateral trade and investment 

agreements. 

Hare Coursing 

Asked by Baroness Kennedy of Cradley 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how many 

reported hare coursing offences there have been in each 

year from 2010 until the latest year for which records 

are available. [HL6526] 

Lord Gardiner of Kimble: The Home Office collects 

data on the number of notifiable crimes recorded by the 

police in England and Wales. However, hare coursing is 

not a notifiable offence so this information is not held 

centrally. 

Asked by Baroness Kennedy of Cradley 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment 

they have made of the deterrent effect of fines for 

persons convicted of hare coursing, in the light of the 

finding by the House Commons Library that the 

average fine is £256.43. [HL6527]

Lord Gardiner of Kimble: Under the Hunting Act 

2004, an individual can receive an unlimited fine if found 

guilty of illegal hunting or hare coursing. Sentencing and 

the level of fine imposed if a person is found guilty is a

European Health Insurance Card, but has nevertheless 

secured one. [HL6406] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: The unit cost of an European 

Health Insurance Card (EHIC) is approximately 72 pence. 

This amount is inclusive of labour and all infrastructure 

costs. 

Information on how many applications for EHICs are 

rejected due to fraudulent, incomplete or false details 

being submitted is not held centrally. 

The Department, on behalf of the United Kingdom 

Government, rather than the National Health Service 

reimburses other European Economic Area (EEA) 

countries and Switzerland for the cost of providing 

treatment to people we are responsible for under 

European Union law, based on pension and benefit 

eligibility, and irrespective of nationality. In the same 

way, other EEA countries and Switzerland reimburse the 

Department, on behalf of the UK Government, for the 

cost of the NHS providing treatment to people they are 

responsible for under EU law, irrespective of nationality 

and including UK nationals insured in another EEA 

country or Switzerland. 

Information on how many claims from hospitals in 

other EEA member states the Department has paid, and 

their value, where it knew the patient was ineligible for an 

EHIC is not held centrally. 

Due to the complexities associated with the collection 

and aggregation of information on costs and treatment, 

claims for EEA medical costs are typically submitted by 

EEA member states (including the UK) up to three, and 

sometimes more, years in arrears. There is then a further, 

and often significant, time lag between the receipt of the 

claim and its payment due to the lengthy process of 

scrutinising and then accepting or rejecting a claim by 

another member state. Therefore, any figures for rejected 

claims may not represent a final, accurate picture for any 

12-month period. 

Hepatitis 

Asked by Baroness Randerson 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

Written Answer by Lord O’Shaughnessy on 22 March 

(HL5975), what steps they are taking to ensure that 

more precise figures on the number of people with 

undiagnosed Hepatitis C are made available. [HL6478] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: Most recent estimates suggest 

that around 160,000 people in England are living with 

chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection. Published figures of 

the number who remain undiagnosed are not available 

although surveillance data and modelling are used to 

generate estimates for healthcare planning assumptions. 

An estimate of the proportion of people who inject 

drugs who are diagnosed can be obtained from the Public 

Health England survey entitled Data tables of the 

Unlinked Anonymous Monitoring Survey of HIV and 

Hepatitis in People Who Inject Drugs. A copy of this 

survey is attached. 

In this survey, only around one half of people injecting 

psychoactive drugs sampled are aware of their HCV 

antibody positive status (53% in 2015), and this figure has 

remained relatively stable at this level (averaging 52%) 

over the past decade.

Hospitals: Nurses 

Asked by Lord Hunt of Chesterton 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what actions they 

are taking to ensure that patients staying overnight in 

hospitals always have access to professional nursing 

support. [HL6424] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: Appropriate staffing levels are a 

core element of the Care Quality Commission’s (CQC) 

registration regime. All providers of regulated activities 

must be registered with the CQC and meet the registration 

requirements. The 16 safety and quality requirements 

include a requirement to take steps to ensure that there are 

sufficient numbers of suitably qualified, skilled and 

experienced staff employed at all times. 

In July 2016, the National Quality Board published 

Supporting NHS providers to deliver the right staff, with 

the right skills, in the right place at the right time: Safe, 

sustainable and productive staffing. This safe staffing 

improvement resource provides an updated set of 

expectations for nursing and midwifery care staffing, to 

help National Health Service provider boards make local 

decisions that will support the delivery of high quality 

care for patients within the available staffing resource. 

There are over 12,100 (7.5%) more nurses on our 

wards, acute, elderly and general, since May 2010.

In Vitro Fertilisation 

Asked by Lord Alton of Liverpool 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, with reference to 

paragraph 2.8 of the minutes of 9 March 2017 of the 

Licence Committee of the Human Fertilisation and 

Embryology Authority (HFEA) regarding babies born 

following pronuclear transfer between embryos, what 

procedures are in place to (1) identify whether a child 

born following pronuclear transfer is born with (a) a 

mitochondrial disease, (b) a genetic or epigenetic 

abnormality, (c) a birth defect, or (d) some other 

adverse outcome, (2) notify the HFEA in cases of any 

such adverse outcome, and (3) identify any such 

adverse outcome and notify the HFEA where consent 

for follow-up has not been granted. [HL6374] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: The Human Fertilisation and 

Embryology Authority (HFEA) has advised that, as set 

out in Guidance Note 33 of the Authority’s code of 

practice, centres carrying out mitochondrial donation are 

required to have documented processes in place setting 

out how the health of children born from mitochondrial 

donation will be followed up. A copy of Guidance Note 

33 is attached. 

If the centre becomes aware that any child born as a 

result of mitochondrial donation has a mitochondrial 

disease, birth defect, genetic abnormality or if there has 

been any other adverse outcome, the centre must report 

this to the HFEA in accordance with the adverse incidents 

requirements set out in Guidance Note 27 of the code of 

practice. A copy of Guidance Note 27 is attached.

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, with reference to 

paragraphs 2.8, 2.9 and 3.17 of the minutes of 9 March 

2017 of the Licence Committee of the Human 

Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, regarding the 

follow-up of children born following pronuclear 

transfer between embryos, who is responsible for the 

follow-up programme in NHS England; what health, 

genetic and epigenetic parameters are to be measured; 

what assessment they have made of the potential for 

long-term medical problems to only become evident 

after five years of age; whether they intend to conduct 

follow-ups beyond five years of age; and whether they 

will place in the Library of the House a copy of the full 

documented processes that are in place setting out how 

follow-ups will be carried out. [HL6409] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: The Human Fertilisation and 

Embryology Authority has advised that the guidance on 

the follow up of any children born following 

mitochondrial donation is set out in paragraph 33.33 in 

Guidance Note 33 of the Authority’s code of practice. 

This requires the centre to have a documented process 

setting out how children born from mitochondrial 

donation will be followed up, where the patients have 

consented to follow-up. These should include long-term 

medical follow-up of the children born. A copy of 

Guidance Note 33 is attached.

NHS: Reorganisation 

Asked by Baroness Byford 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government whether they 

intend that rural proofing will be applied to the NHS 

Sustainability and Transformation Plans. [I] [HL6457] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: NHS England is aware of Rural 

proofing: practical guidance to assess impacts of policies 

on rural areas, published by the Department for 

Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in March 2017. 

All Sustainability and Transformation Plans (STPs) 

build on the Five Year Forward View to present an 

overall strategy for their geographic footprint and identify 

the three to five key priorities required to realise their 

vision. This should take account of specific challenges 

facing each area, which could include a dispersed, rural 

population. 

STPs have been in the public domain for several 

months. Partner organisations within each area are 

engaging both rural and urban communities on their plans 

and, where required by law, consulting on service change. 

NHS England and NHS Improvement continue to 

provide ongoing support to each STP area. In September 

2016, they published Engaging Local People: A guide for 

local areas developing Sustainability and Transformation 

Plans, which set out how STP areas should reach out to 

stakeholders in their areas. A copy of the guidance is 

attached. 

The NHS is exploring ways to better adapt health 

provision for rural areas. For example, the vanguard 

covering Morecambe Bay Health Community is 

improving healthcare in a geographically isolated area by 

using a high definition telemedicine link between a 

general practitioner (GP) surgery in Millom and the 

accident and emergency (A&E) department in Barrow-in-

Furness. This means when GPs can seek a second opinion 

as to whether a patient needs intensive treatment or can be 

treated in the community – they can call through and have 

an A&E specialist examine the patient. This means that 

over the 1,000 square miles that Morecambe Bay covers, 

patients can have access to expert opinion without having 

to travel further than their nearest GP. 

On 31 March, Next steps on the NHS Five Year 

Forward View was published by NHS England. The 

document outlined a 10-point care and efficiency plan 

which will further contribute to improving the health 

outcomes of those living in rural areas. A copy of this 

document is attached.

Overseas Investment: Bosnia and 

Herzegovina 

Asked by The Earl of Dundee 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment 

they have made of economic opportunities for British 

business for investment and partnership in Bosnia and 

Herzegovina. [HL6296] 

Lord Price: There are a number of economic 

opportunities in Bosnia and Herzegovina for UK 

investors, with software development, mining and oil 

exploration identified as particular sectors of opportunity. 

However, HMG also recognises that for more investment 

to succeed Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to make 

significant improvements to its business environment, 

including tackling excess regulation and increasing 

transparency around public procurement and licensing. 

The UK is funding projects to improve the business 

environment by simplifying the process of setting up a 

business and moving to a 'one-stop' shop system. 

Peers: Public Appointments 

Asked by Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government whether there is a 

moratorium on the appointment of new peers by the 

House of Lords Appointment Commission; whether the 

Commission has recommended any new peers since the 

last set of appointments in October 2015; and whether it 

plans to appoint any new peers in 2017. [HL6291] 

Lord Young of Cookham: There has been no change 

to the appointments process, which is that appointments 

to the House of Lords continue to be made by the 

Sovereign on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. 

This includes those nominations for non party political 

peerages made on the advice of the House of Lords 

Appointments Commission. There have been no changes 

made to the Commission's remit. Any future 

announcements about appointments to the House of Lords 

will be made in the usual way.

that 3.2 million adults in working families were in 

relative poverty in 2015–16, what action they will take 

to reduce in-work poverty. [HL6346] 

Lord Henley: Latest statistics to 2016 show 3.2 million 

working-age adults in working families living in relative 

low income before housing costs. This compares with 2.8 

million in 2010. In terms of percentages, in 2016 this 

equates to 8% of all working-age adults and similarly in 

2010 this was also 8% of all working-age adults. 

However there are currently record numbers of people 

in work – 2.8 million more since 2010. As a consequence, 

this has resulted in some increases in the number of 

individuals in work and in low income. 

We realise that some people first moving into work 

might be in low income in the short term. But by being in 

work they have the opportunity of increasing their 

earnings, rather than just being left to live a life on 

benefits. 

We are introducing Universal Credit and this is 

revolutionising the welfare system by making work pay. 

Universal Credit contains structural incentives to 

encourage people to work more and earn more. It is 

simple and as people’s earnings increase their payments 

reduce at a steady rate (there are no cliff edges), so it is 

clear to them that they will always be better off working 

and earning more. 

We have also increased the tax free Personal Allowance 

so that people can earn more and keep more of what they 

earn and introduced the National Living Wage. The tax-

free personal allowance will be £11,500 in April 2017, a 

major step towards our goal of reaching £12,500 by 2021. 

As of April 2017, a typical basic rate taxpayer will pay 

over £1,000 less income tax, compared to 2010-11. This 

will be an income tax cut for over 30 million people and 

will mean taking 4 million of the lowest paid out of 

income tax completely during the last Parliament. The 

introduction of the National Living Wage, means a full-

time worker previously on the national minimum wage is 

now £900 a year better off. 

These changes, combined with the highest employment 

rate on record – mean that work continues to be the best 

route out of low income. Just 6% of working-age adults in 

households where everyone is working are in relative low 

income before housing costs, compared to nearly half 

(46%) of adults in workless households. 

Primodos 

Asked by Lord Alton of Liverpool 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

Written Answer by Lord O’Shaughnessy on 28 March 

(HL6261), whether the Expert Working Group on 

Hormonal Pregnancy Tests will review the reasons why 

tests on Primodos, which remained on the market until 

1978 despite the publication of a study in 1967 

indicating a causal relationship between hormonal 

pregnancy tests and congenital abnormalities, were not 

ordered by the Committee for the Safety of Medicines 

under the Medicines Act 1971. [HL6408] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: The terms of reference of the 

Expert Working Group on Hormonal Pregnancy Tests are 

focused on a scientific review of the strength of evidence 

for a possible association between exposure in pregnancy 

to hormonal pregnancy tests and adverse outcomes in 

pregnancy. An important part of the Group’s work is to 

consider what lessons may be learnt for further improving 

existing regulatory systems to identify, monitor and 

minimise any adverse effects of medicines in pregnancy. 

Records show that the Committee on Safety of Drugs 

(subsequently the Committee on Safety of Medicines) 

carefully considered the results of the 1967 study and 

considered the methodology to be flawed. 

In 1969, the Committee on Safety of Drugs requested 

the manufacturers of hormonal pregnancy tests to provide 

all relevant laboratory data and initiated their own long-

term study of maternal drug histories in mothers of 

children with birth defects. In 1970, the Standing 

Committee on the Classification of Proprietary Medicines 

(the ‘MacGregor Committee’) asked Schering, the then 

licence holder, to remove ‘diagnosis of pregnancy’ from 

the indications for Primodos. 

Asked by Lord Alton of Liverpool 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

Written Answer by Lord O’Shaughnessy on 28 March 

(HL6261), whether they will meet with Marie Lyon and 

representatives of the Primodos victims support group. 

[HL6511] 

Asked by Lord Alton of Liverpool 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

Written Answer by Lord O’Shaughnessy on 28 March 

(HL6261), whether the Expert Working Group on 

Hormonal Pregnancy Tests will review (1) the terms of 

reference of (a) the Committee on the Safety of 

Medicines, and (b) the Metabolic Research Unit, when 

determining what lessons may be learnt for further 

improving existing regulatory systems to identify, 

monitor and minimise any adverse effects of medicines 

in pregnancy, (2) the need to assemble and assess 

reports of adverse reactions to drugs trials, and (3) how 

ministers should be advised of the outcomes of those 

trials. [HL6515] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: One of the terms of reference of 

the Expert Working Group on Hormonal Pregnancy Tests 

is to consider what lessons may be learnt for further 

improving existing regulatory systems to identify, 

monitor and minimise any adverse effects of medicines in 

pregnancy. The regulatory, legal and social landscape has 

changed significantly since hormonal pregnancy tests 

were on the market; many of these changes have been 

driven by previous experience. The Group will consider 

the processes and tools that were available to the United 

Kingdom regulator when hormonal pregnancy tests were 

on the market and make recommendations for any 

changes necessary to further improve the capability of

Public Sector: Leadership 

Asked by The Earl of Dundee 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment 

they have made of the possible benefits to the national 

health and police services of encouraging good 

leadership and psychological wellbeing within those 

services. [HL6495] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: The Department considers good 

leadership and psychological wellbeing within the 

National Health Service in England is essential to 

delivering excellent patient care. This is the responsibility 

of each individual NHS organisation. 

Good leadership is required at every level of the NHS. 

Trusts which the Care Quality Commission considers to 

have outstanding leadership are much more likely to be 

rated outstanding overall; effective, values driven 

leadership delivers high-quality care. The NHS 

Leadership Academy provides development and support 

to people working in the NHS and aims to improve 

leadership behaviours and skills across the service. 

In respect of psychological wellbeing, NHS England is 

leading an initiative to improve the overall health and 

wellbeing of NHS staff which includes, for example, 

access to mental health talking therapies. They have also 

made available Commissioning for Quality and 

Innovation incentive payments to encourage trusts to 

improve the physical and mental health support provided 

to their staff. 

The Department continues to commission NHS 

Employers to support the NHS in improving staff health 

and wellbeing through advice, guidance and good practice 

including, for example, their online-only How are you 

feeling NHS? Toolkit which should help staff check their 

own emotional wellbeing or speak to and support 

colleagues with theirs. 

The Department has not made an assessment of 

leadership and wellbeing in the police service.

March (HL6062), whether they will consider 

substituting bus services at less busy times for 

passenger train services, in order to release capacity to 

operate more freight trains. [HL6281] 

Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon: The specification and 

provision of rail replacement  services is a commercial 

and operational matter for the operator and Network Rail. 

If a proposal were to be brought forward by the train 

operator and Network Rail, we would consider this matter 

carefully. No proposal has however been submitted. 

Social Security Benefits: Children 

Asked by The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what steps they 

are taking to ensure that potential claimants are aware 

of the introduction of the two-child limit on Child Tax 

Credit and the child element of Universal Credit. 

[HL6398] 

Baroness Neville-Rolfe: Claimants were alerted to the 

policy changes at the time they were announced by high 

level messaging on the GOV.UK website in 2015. 

Tax credits claimants were informed about the 

upcoming policy change in a letter that was sent with their 

renewals notices between April and June 2016. A follow 

up flyer will go out in all new claims packs and renewals 

packs from April 2017. 

In August 2016 high level amendments were made to 

the GOV.UK website’s information about Child Tax 

Credit to advise potential claimants about these changes. 

Further details were published as part of a consultation 

in October 2016 and in response to the consultation in 

January 2017. 

HM Revenue and Customs and the Department for 

Work and Pensions (DWP) have also worked with 

representative bodies and stakeholders who will be able to 

advise claimants about the changes. 

All tax credits products (for example, award notices, 

leaflets, and supporting notes) have been updated with a 

high level message outlining the new policy. 

DWP will offer support to claimants through Jobcentres 

by trained staff as needed.

St Helena: Overseas Aid 

Asked by Lord Shutt of Greetland 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what is the 

process by which they determine the level of the annual 

revenue support grant to St Helena. [HL6483] 

Asked by Lord Shutt of Greetland 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what consultation 

and engagement they have with members of the St 

Helena Council prior to decisions being made on the 

amount of UK Government support which will be 

provided for the forthcoming financial year. [HL6484] 

Asked by Lord Shutt of Greetland 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, when determining 

the annual revenue support grant to be allocated to St 

Helena, how much time is given to the St Helena 

Council to consider the local taxation that it will need to 

raise; and what representations they have received 

regarding the adequacy of the length of time given. 

[HL6485] 

Asked by Lord Shutt of Greetland 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, in the light of the 

statement in their policy paper,  2010 to 2015 

government policy: UK Overseas Territories, that the 

reasonable assistance needs of overseas territories "are 

a first call on the UK’s international development 

budget", why the St Helena Council had not been 

informed, as of 30 March, how much its annual revenue 

support grant for 2017–18 will be; and what assessment 

they have made of the impact of the timing of the 

funding decision on the ability of the Council to make 

financial plans. [HL6486] 

Lord Bates: The process to determine the level of UK 

Government financial support to St Helena for 2017/18 

has followed standard DFID procedures. It began during 

November 2016 when the St Helena Government (SHG) 

provided budget forecasts and DFID officials visited the 

island for intense discussions of the budget proposals. 

Elected Members took an active role throughout these 

discussions. 

A revised budget from SHG in January provided more 

detailed and prioritised spending projections. Following 

internal quality assurance Ministers approved the level of 

DFID’s contribution to the budget on 30 March 2017. 

This approval was relayed to SHG Officials on 31 March. 

Throughout the process DFID officials were in regular 

contact with their SHG counterparts. Financial Aid makes 

an important contribution to the long term growth and 

development of St Helena. 

The UK Government has a duty to ensure value for 

taxpayers’ money as it meets its international 

commitments. 

Trade Promotion: Bosnia and Herzegovina 

Asked by The Earl of Dundee 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what steps they 

are taking to promote trade between the UK and Bosnia 

and Herzegovina. [HL6295] 

Lord Price: According to the latest data from the FCO 

Economics Unit (2015), UK exports (goods and services) 

to Bosnia and Herzegovina were £57 million with UK 

imports reaching £53 million in 2015. (Data for 2016 will 

be published in April). In FY 2017/18 the HMG team 

based in Sarajevo will continue to promote trade 

opportunities across the mining, oil and gas, retail, 

infrastructure and security sectors which will include a 

series of tailored events in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the 

UK and across the wider Central and Eastern European 

region. 

Transfer Pricing: Statistics 

Asked by Lord Harries of Pentregarth 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government whether they have 

discontinued the publication of annual Transfer Pricing 

statistics; and if so, why. [HL6347] 

Baroness Neville-Rolfe: HM Revenue and Customs 

has not discontinued the publication of these statistics. 

The Department intends to publish the transfer pricing 

statistics shortly. 

Universal Credit: Children 

Asked by The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how many 

families with three or more children born before April 

2017 they project will be affected by the introduction of 

the two-child limit on Universal Credit. [HL6397] 

Lord Henley: The information requested is not 

available. 

University Technical Colleges 

Asked by Lord Allen of Kensington 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government which universities 

are partners in university technical colleges; and which 

technical specialisms those universities support. 

[HL6508] 

Lord Nash: There are 48 open UTCs. The attachment 

lists their technical specialism and their university 

sponsors. The universities support the specialisms in a 

range of ways. 

The Answer includes the following attached material:

Asked by Lord Allen of Kensington 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how they intend to 

encourage more universities to become involved in the 

university technical colleges programme. [HL6509] 

Lord Nash: We outlined in the Schools that Work for 

Everyone consultation our proposals for universities 

having a greater involvement in the establishment and 

sponsorship of schools including UTCs. The consultation 

ended on 12 December 2016. The results of the 

consultation and the department’s response will be 

published on GOV.UK in Spring 2017. 

We have awarded a grant to the Baker Dearing 

Educational Trust to provide advice, guidance and support 

to universities and others wishing to submit applications 

to establish University Technical Colleges (UTCs).
