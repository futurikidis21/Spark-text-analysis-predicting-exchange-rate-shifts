Register of Beneficial Owners of Overseas 

Companies and Other Legal Entities: Call 

for Evidence 

[HLWS592] 

Lord Prior of Brampton: Today we are publishing a 

call for evidence seeking views on a new register that will 

show who owns and controls overseas companies and 

other legal entities that own UK property or participate in 

UK Government procurement. 

The intention to create this register was announced at 

the International Anti-Corruption Summit held in the UK 

last May. In providing greater transparency, the register 

will play a vital role in helping to combat corruption and 

money laundering. Greater transparency will also enhance 

the UK’s reputation as an open and stable place to invest. 

Last year the UK became the first country in the G20 to 

introduce a register of UK company beneficial ownership. 

The new register will impose similar requirements on 

overseas entities that choose to invest in property in the 

UK or bid to provide central Government contracts here. 

The creation of this register will ensure that the UK 

continues to be at the forefront of the corporate 

transparency and anti-corruption agenda.

Written Answers 
Wednesday, 5 April 2017 

Air Force: Training 

Asked by Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what estimate they 

have made of the annual cost of pilot training to the 

RAF. [HL6453] 

Earl Howe: Pilot training costs cannot be readily 

broken out of overall training costs. Information regarding 

the annual cost of pilot training to the RAF is not held 

centrally and can be provided only at disproportionate 

cost. 

Air Pollution: Greater Manchester 

Asked by Baroness Featherstone 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how many deaths 

have been attributed to air pollution in Greater 

Manchester in each of the last five years. [HL6287] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: The fraction of annual all-cause 

adult mortality attributable to anthropogenic (human-

made) particulate air pollution (measured as fine 

particulate matter, PM 2.5) is provided by the Public 

Health Outcomes Framework (PHOF) indicator 3.01. 

This calculates the mortality burden associated with 

long-term exposure to anthropogenic particulate air 

pollution at current levels, expressed as the percentage of 

annual deaths from all causes in those aged over 30. 

The following table shows the fraction of mortality (%) 

attributable to particulate air pollution extracted from the 

PHOF 3.01 indicator, for the period 2010-2015, for 

England, North West and areas within the Greater 

Manchester Area (GMA), as GMA is not an 

administrative area.

Average Earnings 

Asked by Lord Triesman 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what is their 

estimate of the average per capita gross annual pay in 

each of the last five years, broken down by electoral 

division in the 23 June 2016 referendum. [HL6191] 

Lord Young of Cookham: The information requested 

falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics 

Authority. I have asked the Authority to reply.

Bahrain: Prisoners 

Asked by Lord Hylton 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government whether they will 

make representations to the government of Bahrain for 

the release from prison of (1) Abduljalil al-Singace, (2) 

Hussain Hubail, and (3) Hasan Mushaima, in the light 

of their medical conditions. [HL6324] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: We encourage all those 

with concerns about their treatment in detention to report 

these directly to the Ministry of Interior Ombudsman. We 

also continue to encourage the Government of Bahrain to 

deliver on its international and domestic human rights 

commitments. We continue to raise concerns about 

human rights with the Bahraini authorities both in private 

and in public. 

Brexit 

Asked by Lord Teverson 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

remarks by the Secretary of State for Exiting the 

European Union on 2 February (HC Deb, col 1226), to 

which local councils the Minister of State for Exiting 

the European Union has sent invitations to discuss 

Brexit. [HL6179] 

Lord Bridges of Headley: The Government is seeking 

to engage local councils as we exit the European Union. 

The leaders of local government associations in England, 

Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were invited and 

met with the Minister of State for Exiting the European 

Union on 21 February. The Secretary of State for Exiting 

the European Union has committed to meeting combined 

authority mayors once they are elected in May and further 

ministerial engagement with councils is planned after the 

May local government elections.

Written Answers 5 April 2017 Page 3 

Asked by Lord Teverson 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, in the light of the 

White Paper The United Kingdom’s exit from, and new 

partnership with, the European Union, Cm 9417, how 

many of the around 150 stakeholder engagement events 

held across the UK by ministers from the Department 

for Exiting the European Union took place in (1) the 

South-West of England, and (2) Cornwall. [HL6180] 

Lord Bridges of Headley: The DExEU Ministerial 

team has committed to visiting every region of the UK. 

Ministers from the whole of Government have held 

meetings across the country to prepare for the 

negotiations. Ministers have visited the South West of 

England twice since the creation of the Department; 

DExEU ministers are yet to visit Cornwall 

We are planning more regional visits throughout the 

UK, including to the South West of England, as we 

continue to build a national consensus around our 

negotiating position 

Details of Ministerial meetings will be published in the 

Department's Quarterly Transparency Returns, which will 

be made publicly available on GOV.UK. 

Asked by Lord Teverson 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what engagement 

the Department for Exiting the European Union has had 

with Cornwall since that Department was formed in 

July 2016. [HL6181] 

Lord Bridges of Headley: The DExEU Ministerial 

team has committed to visiting every region of the UK. 

Ministers from the whole of Government have held 

meetings across the country to prepare for the 

negotiations. Ministers have visited the South West of 

England twice since the creation of the Department; 

DExEU ministers are yet to visit Cornwall. 

We are planning more regional visits throughout the 

UK, including to the South West of England, as we 

continue our engagement and seek to build a national 

consensus around our negotiating position. 

Details of Ministerial meetings will be published in the 

Department's Quarterly Transparency Returns, which will 

be made publicly available on GOV.UK. 

Cervical Cancer: Developing Countries 

Asked by Baroness Tonge 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what priority they 

give to the detection and treatment of cervical cancer in 

developing country programmes, in the light of the 

WHO’s  Projections of mortality and causes of death 

2015 and 2030  which indicates that global deaths from 

cervical cancer will be more than twice the level of the 

global maternal mortality rate by 2030. [HL6437] 

Lord Bates: The UK government recognises the 

significant burden of cervical cancer in developing 

countries. The UK is the largest contributor to Gavi, the 

Vaccine Alliance, which vaccinates girls in developing 

countries against Human Papillomavirus, the virus that 

causes cervical cancer. By 2020, Gavi will vaccinate 40 

million girls against Human Papillomavirus, preventing 

900,000 deaths. 

Chemicals: Seas and Oceans 

Asked by Lord Hunt of Chesterton 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government which 

organisation is responsible for providing public 

information about chemicals which are dispersed into 

the seas surrounding the UK; and what steps they are 

taking to require industry and UN organisations to 

reduce such dispersals. [HL6319] 

Lord Gardiner of Kimble: Defra and the Devolved 

Administrations have provided information to the public 

about chemicals dispersed to the UK seas through their 

public consultations on the assessment of the State of the 

UK Seas set out in UK Marine Strategy Part 1. This 

assessment will be updated in 2018. 

Under the Marine Strategy Part 3, Defra and the 

Devolved Administrations have set out a programme of 

measures which reduce contaminant concentrations in the 

marine environment to acceptable levels. These include 

various pollution reduction requirements for emissions 

and discharges from industry, and measures for coastal 

waters that are set out in the Water Framework Directive 

River Basin Management Plans, published by the UK 

environment agencies. 

The UK also contributes to, and implements, the 

obligations of several UN initiatives, which protect the 

world’s oceans from mercury, persistent organic 

pollutants, hazardous wastes, hazardous chemicals and 

pesticides. 

The UK, as a signatory to the Oslo and Paris 

Convention (OSPAR), submits annual returns of the 

quantities of contaminants which enter UK seas. This 

information is made available via the OSPAR website. 

The UK Government is committed to the effective 

delivery of UN Sustainable Development Goal 14, 

including target 14.1 ”By 2025, prevent and significantly 

reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from 

land-based activities, including marine debris and 

nutrient pollution ”. The Government welcomes the fact 

that the 3 United Nations Environment Assembly will 

focus on all forms of pollution, including marine 

pollution. 

Conditions of Employment 

Asked by Lord Monks 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what steps they 

are taking to ensure that the interests of UK workers are 

taken into account during Article 50 negotiations.

Asked by Lord Monks 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how they intend to 

involve the TUC and trade unions in the Article 50 

negotiations. [HL6240] 

Lord Bridges of Headley: This government has made 

a clear commitment to protect workers’ rights, and ensure 

that they keep pace with the changing labour market as 

we leave the EU. Furthermore, we do not need to be part 

of the EU to have strong protections for workers' rights - 

the UK already goes beyond EU minimum standards in a 

number of areas. 

Both DExEU Ministers and senior officials have met a 

wide range of interested organisations to hear concerns 

and gather insight. So far, the Secretary of State, the 

Permanent Secretary, and DExEU officials have met the 

TUC, and the Secretary of State has met UNISON. This 

engagement will continue as we move into the negotiation 

phase of our exit from the EU and will help to inform our 

negotiating positions. 

Details of Ministerial meetings, and those of senior 

officials, will be published in the Department’s Quarterly 

Transparency Returns, which will be made publicly 

available on GOV.UK. 

Fly-tipping 

Asked by Baroness Byford 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

answer by the Earl of Courtown on 8 March (HL Deb, 

col 1357), whether, following a successful prosecution 

by the Environment Agency for fly-tipping, landowners 

will receive recompense for costs incurred in having 

rubbish removed. [I] [HL6459] 

Lord Gardiner of Kimble: Where a person is 

convicted of an offence under section 33 of the 

Environmental Protection Act 1990 (the ‘fly-tipping’), 

section 33B (2) of that Act provides that “loss or damage 

resulting from the offence” in section 130 of the Powers 

of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 specifically 

includes costs incurred or to be incurred by a relevant 

person in removing the waste deposited or disposed of in 

or on the land; taking other steps to eliminate or reduce 

the consequences of the deposit or disposal; or both. 

A “relevant person” is defined for these purposes in 

section 33B (3) as including the occupier of the land and 

the owner of the land. 

A court can order the person convicted of fly-tipping to 

pay compensation to the occupier or owner of the land in 

respect of costs incurred or to be incurred in removing the 

waste and/or associated clean-up costs. Whether a court 

would in any particular case make such an order will 

depend on the nature of the case, any other form of 

punishment to which the offender is to be sentenced, and 

the financial means of the offender to pay. Once a 

compensation order is made the courts have a role in 

enforcing that order to ensure that monies are paid. This is 

reflected in the sentencing guideline. The application of 

the guideline is a matter for the court to decide. A copy of 

this document will be placed in the Library. 

In Vitro Fertilisation 

Asked by Lord Alton of Liverpool 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, following the 

award by the Licence Committee of the Human 

Fertilisation and Embryology Authority of a licence to 

Centre 0017 to carry out pronuclear transfer between 

embryos to prevent transmission of serious 

mitochondrial disease, what safeguards Centre 0017 has 

put in place to ensure that early pronuclear transfer will 

take place during treatment at precisely the same 

epigenetic stage in donor and recipient embryos, given 

the rapid rate of DNA demethylation and the different 

rates of embryo development at the early pronuclear 

stage. [HL6372] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: The Human Fertilisation and 

Embryology Authority (HFEA) has advised the expert 

panel considered all the evidence that it believed was 

relevant to the safety and efficacy of mitochondrial 

donation techniques. The panel did not make any 

recommendations relating to epigenetics and so the HFEA 

has placed no such requirements on centres wishing to 

offer mitochondrial donation. 

Asked by Lord Alton of Liverpool 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, with reference to 

paragraph 2.3 of the minutes of 9 March 2017 of the 

Licence Committee of the Human Fertilisation and 

Embryology Authority, which non-CE marked reagents 

will be used by Centre 0017 for the purposes of 

treatment involving pronuclear transfer between 

embryos to prevent transmission of serious 

mitochondrial disease; which laboratories will test the 

non-CE marked reagents for sterility and toxicity; and 

why non-CE marked reagents are being used. [HL6373] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: The Human Fertilisation and 

Embryology Authority has advised that it is a condition of 

a licence that CE marked medical devices must be used 

wherever possible. In the case of pronuclear transfer, 

there are no appropriate CE marked reagents, meaning 

that for treatment to take place, non-CE marked reagents 

must be used. In this case, the centre must adhere to 

paragraph 26.5 in Guidance Note 26 of the Authority’s 

code of practice, which states that if a centre modifies a 

CE marked product or uses a product “off label”, it must 

complete a risk assessment and validation to ensure the 

product is safe. A copy of the Guidance Note 26 is 

attached.

Iraq: Islamic State 

Asked by Lord Alton of Liverpool 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, following the 

discovery of a further mass grave in Khafsa, Iraq, what 

progress is being made in establishing international 

judicial mechanisms to bring to justice supporters of 

ISIS who are accused of genocide and crimes against 

humanity. [HL6329] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: The recent discovery of 

the mass grave in Khasfa provides further evidence of the 

appalling crimes Daesh have committed against the 

people of Iraq. We are committed to bringing Daesh to 

justice for these crimes. Investigative and prosecutorial 

work is already underway across the world. We are 

working closely with the Government of Iraq and other 

international partners to identify further ways to take this 

work forward, including at the UN. 

Islamic State 

Asked by Lord Hylton 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment 

they have made of the case for a British political, 

diplomatic and intelligence presence in north and north-

east Syria to support the struggle against Daesh in Syria 

and Iraq. [HL6323] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: The British Embassy in 

Damascus suspended all services in March 2012. 

Diplomatic personnel were withdrawn from Syria because 

of the deteriorating political and security situation. We 

continue to advise against all travel to Syria. 

UK officials at the British Embassies in Beirut and 

Amman and the Consul General in Istanbul follow 

developments in Syria closely, as do staff in London. We 

meet a wide range of Syrian representatives, including 

from north-east Syria. As a leading member of the Global 

Coalition, we also work closely with coalition partners in 

the fight against Daesh, routinely consulting on all aspects 

of the campaign to defeat Daesh. 

Married People: Tax Allowances 

Asked by Lord Farmer 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how much was 

budgeted for the Marriage Allowance in (1) 2015–16, 

and (2) 2016–17; and what are future expenditure 

projections for Marriage Allowance to 2019–20. 

[HL6282] 

Asked by Lord Farmer 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how much was 

spent on Marriage Allowance in (1) 2015–16, and (2) 

2016–17. [HL6283] 

Asked by Lord Farmer 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how many (1) 

individuals, and (2) couples, currently in receipt of 

Universal Credit are eligible for the Marriage 

Allowance. [HL6284] 

Asked by Lord Farmer 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment 

they have made of the income profile of Marriage 

Allowance claimants. [HL6285] 

Asked by Lord Farmer 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how many people 

in the lowest two income deciles claim Marriage 

Allowance. [HL6286] 

Asked by Lord Farmer 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how much was 

budgeted for Married Couples Allowance in 2016–17; 

and what are their future expenditure projections. 

[HL6304] 

Asked by Lord Farmer 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how much was 

spent on Married Couples Allowance in 2016–17. 

[HL6305] 

Asked by Lord Farmer 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government whether they have 

data on the income profile of Married Couples 

Allowance claimants; and if so, how many claimants 

are in the top half of the income distribution percentiles 

50–99, and how many in the bottom half, broken down 

into percentiles (1) 1–20, and (2) 21–49. [HL6306] 

Baroness Neville-Rolfe: The Marriage Allowance was 

introduced in 2015-16 to recognise the importance of 

marriage in the tax system. Around 1.8m people have 

claimed the allowance to date. 

Our current best estimate assessment of the initial cost 

of this allowance is £140m in 2015-16, but this does not 

include the impact of any expected future claims, which 

can be backdated to this year. We forecast the total cost of 

this allowance to rise to £385m in 2015-16 once these 

claims are taken into account. 

An estimate of the initial cost of this allowance for 

2016-17 will not be available until the end of the tax year. 

We forecast an eventual cost to the exchequer of £425m, 

once all backdated claims are taken into account. 

Marriage Allowance claims can be made up to 4 years 

after the tax year has finished. The expected future 

projections of the Marriage Allowance final cost for 

2019-20 is not available because this depends on our 

forecast of backdated applications, and the forecast period 

does not currently extend out to 2023-24. 

HM Treasury does not hold information relating to the 

income deciles of claimants or successful applicants of 

the Marriage Allowance. Previous analysis of the total 

eligible population has shown the majority of the benefits 

of this policy go to the bottom half of the income 

distribution. Only basic rate taxpayers and non-taxpayers 

will benefit.

HM Treasury does not hold information about how 

many individuals claiming Universal Credit are eligible 

for the Marriage Allowance. 

The number of claimants of Married Couple's 

Allowance by the income groups requested is set out for 

the latest outturn year available (2014-15): 

   Thousand 

Percentile 
Groups (ranged 

on total income 

before tax) 

   

 Bottom 20% 20%-50% Top 50% 

2014-15 31 304 385 

The cost of the Married Couples Allowance is forecast 

to be £220m in 2016-17. It is expected that the cost of this 

relief will decline, as it is restricted to couples where at 

least one of them is born before 6 April 1935. 

Mesothelioma 

Asked by Lord Wills 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

Written Answer by Lord O’Shaughnessy on 27 March, 

whether any data is collected on the cost of 

mesothelioma to the NHS; and if so, what. [HL6371] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: Data on the cost of 

mesothelioma to the National Health Service is not 

collected centrally. 

NHS: Negligence 

Asked by Lord Freyberg 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

Written Answer by Lord O’Shaughnessy on 27 March 

(HL6013), and in the light of the summary of the cause 

and injury codes used by the NHS Litigation Authority, 

what is the total number and value of claims associated 

with each code, suitably normalised and broken down 

into (1) cause and injury codes with 5 or more claims 

associated, (2) cause and injury codes with between 2 

and 4 claims associated, (3) cause and injury codes with 

only 1 claim associated, and (4) cause and injury codes 

with no claim associated, for the last full financial year 

for which records are available. [HL6394] 

Asked by Lord Freyberg 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

Written Answer by Lord O’Shaughnessy on 27 March 

(HL6013), whether ad hoc analysis has been undertaken 

over the last five years to match claims or injury codes 

to particular diseases or broader activities, either by the 

NHS Litigation Authority or by third parties such as 

academics or consultants with access to their data; for 

which diseases those analyses have been undertaken, 

when and by whom; whether summary results from 

those analyses are available, and if so, where; and how 

many claims were associated with each of those 

diseases at the time of the analysis. [HL6395] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: The National Health Service 

Litigation Authority (NHS LA) has not undertaken any ad 

hoc analysis over the last five years to match claims or 

injury codes to particular diseases or broader activities. 

Due to the large amount of data in relation to the cause 

and injury codes used in the NHS LA claims management 

system to identify five claims or more, this information is 

attached. 

It is not possible to provide data on cause and injury 

codes with between two and four claims associated and 

with only one claim associated, as this could lead to the 

re-identification of an individual. 

The following table shows the number of claims by 

primary cause codes with 0 claims associated for 2015 –

North Korea: Electronic Warfare 

Asked by Lord Alton of Liverpool 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment 

they have made of (1) North Korean cyber attacks, and 

(2) reports that the regime has been responsible for a 

$81 million bank cyber heist. [HL6330] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: As detailed in the 

National Cyber Security Strategy, we know that there are 

several established and capable states and state-sponsored 

groups seeking to penetrate UK networks. The UK 

currently considers public attribution of cyber attacks on a 

case-by-case basis. In 2014, the FBI found that North 

Korea was responsible for the malicious cyber activity 

against Sony Pictures Entertainment. The former Foreign 

Secretary (Mr Hammond) publicly condemned this 

activity. We are aware of reports linking North Korea 

with cyber-enabled crime. 

To meet the challenges of cyber threats, on 1 November 

2016 the Government launched the National Cyber 

Security Strategy. Supported by £1.9 billion of 

transformational investment, the strategy sets out 

ambitious policies and capabilities to protect the UK in 

cyber space. 

North Korea: Terrorism 

Asked by Lord Alton of Liverpool 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

Written Answer by Baroness Anelay of St Johns on 5 

November 2015 (HL 2969) which stated that "the 

DPRK is not known to have sponsored any terrorist acts 

since 1987", whether they classify as the sponsoring of 

terrorist acts (1) the plot by a North Korean defector to 

kill Park Sang-hak in 2012, (2) the plot by two North 

Korean military officers to kill Hwang Jang-yop in 

2010, and (3) the claims made by Won Jeong-hwa that 

she had been given orders by North Korea to 

assassinate two South Korean army intelligence officers 

with poison; and if not, why not. [HL6328] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: We are aware of reports 

which allege the involvement of the Democratic People's 

Republic of Korea (DPRK) government in these unlawful 

events in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the actions 

taken by the ROK authorities in response to these 

incidents. Whether or not they amount to acts of terrorism 

under our domestic legal definition would be a matter for 

the investigating authorities to establish. We continue to 

have significant ongoing concerns regarding the DPRK's 

flagrant disregard for international norms and standards. 

We regularly raise these issues directly with the DPRK 

government. 

Occupational Pensions: Tax Allowances 

Asked by Baroness Altmann 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what estimate they 

have made of the cost of extra tax relief due to lower 

than expected opt-out rates from workplace automatic 

enrolment in the tax years (1) 2013–14, (2) 2014–15, 

and (3) 2015–16. [HL6276] 

Baroness Neville-Rolfe: Estimates are not available for 

the extra tax relief due to lower than expected opt-out 

rates from workplace automatic enrolment. However, the 

Government remains committed to supporting people 

saving for retirement. 

Automatic Enrolment has produced a significant change 

in private pension saving and has already reversed the 

decline seen in the decade prior to its introduction. As at 

the end of February, over 7.5 million people had been 

enrolled into a workplace pension. 

Palestinians: Hospitals 

Asked by Baroness Sheehan 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, in the light of a 

reported increase in permit denials for medical staff of 

al Makassed Hospital who live in the West Bank and 

Gaza, what assessment they have made of the impact of 

those denials on patient treatment. [HL6414] 

Lord Bates: According to the World Health 

Organisation, permit denials for medical staff of Al 

Makassed hospital increased in 2016 with 21 reported 

permit denials compared to 10 permit denials in 2015. 

Permit delays and denials can lead to missed 

appointments and interrupted treatments. Movement of 

Palestinian medical staff from the West Bank and Gaza is 

essential for effective healthcare. HMG has consistently 

called on Israel to improve movement and access for 

Palestinians, including medical staff. 

Pensions: Tax Allowances 

Asked by Baroness Altmann 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what estimate they 

have made of the savings to HM Treasury in terms of 

tax relief which would be gained if the annual 

allowance for pension contributions were reduced from 

£40,000 a year to (a) £30,000 a year, (2) £25,000 a 

year, and (3) £20,000 a year. [HL6274]

Asked by Baroness Altmann 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what estimate they 

have made of the savings of (1) tax, and (2) National 

Insurance relief, of restricting the annual allowance for 

pension contributions in defined contribution pension 

schemes to £25,000 a year. [HL6277] 

Asked by Baroness Altmann 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what estimate they 

have made of the savings of reducing the annual 

allowance for pension contributions in defined benefit 

pension schemes to £25,000 a year. [HL6278] 

Baroness Neville-Rolfe: The impacts of reducing the 

Annual Allowance from £40,000 a year would depend 

upon a number of factors including earnings growth and 

behavioural response to the policy change. 

A costings note for the reduction of the Annual 

Allowance from £50,000 to £40,000 and the Lifetime 

Allowance from £1.5 million to £1.25 million was 

published at Autumn Statement 2012 [1] .

Asked by Baroness Altmann 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what estimate they 

have made of the cost of restricting pensions tax relief 

to basic rate tax relief only. [HL6275] 

Baroness Neville-Rolfe: The cost of restricting 

pensions tax relief to basic rate tax relief only would 

depend on how any changes were implemented. The 

impacts on tax receipts would also be subject to 

behavioural effects. 

Qatar: Industrial Health and Safety 

Asked by Lord Triesman 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what estimate (1) 

they, and (2) the International Labour Organisation, 

have made of the number of (a) deaths, and (b) serious 

injuries, which have occurred on stadium and hotel 

building sites in Qatar in the last two calendar years. 

[HL6193] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: The Government is 

aware of the death of five construction workers over the 

past two years – of which two were workplace accidents 

on world cup building sites, and the other three were 

health-related. We do not have any figures for serious 

injuries and do not estimate them. 

RAF Northolt 

Asked by Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government whether they have 

considered opening RAF Northolt to scheduled 

commercial flights. [HL6451] 

Earl Howe: No. 

Religious Freedom 

Asked by Lord Alton of Liverpool 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what instructions 

have been given to FCO country desk officers to ensure 

that freedom of religion or belief is included in their 

work. [HL6376] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: Advancing human 

rights - including the right to freedom of religion and 

belief (FoRB) - is embedded across the work of our 

diplomats. In order to enhance the capabilities of staff 

working to promote FoRB in their country context, the 

FCO issued a revised toolkit in October 2016. This 

coincided with our London Conference on FoRB and 

Countering Violent Extremism, which was attended by a 

number of country desk officers. The FCO also routinely 

provides training and seminars to increase religious 

literacy amongst staff. 

Schools: Publications 

Asked by Lord Hunt of Chesterton 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what measures 

they are taking to ensure that the number of textbooks 

and library books available in maintained schools is not 

reduced, and that that number is not reduced in 

comparison to the number of books available in private 

schools. [HL6423] 

Lord Nash: We want all schools to have the resources 

they need, and through our careful management of the 

economy we have been able to protect the core schools 

budget in real terms. School funding is now at its highest 

level on record at more than £40bn in 2016-17 - and that 

is set to rise, as pupil numbers rise over the next two 

years, to £42 billion by 2019-20. 

We agree that high quality textbooks are important in 

delivering high quality education. Schools are best placed 

to determine appropriate teaching resources which they 

fund from within their budgets. We do not collect detailed 

information on the purchase of books in schools. 

We believe that school libraries play a key role in 

encouraging young people to read for pleasure. We 

believe that it should be for schools to decide whether to 

provide and maintain a library service for their pupils.

Somaliland: Politics and Government 

Asked by Lord Luce 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what support they 

are providing to Somaliland to enhance political 

stability in that country. [HL6170] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: The UK remains 

committed to enhancing political stability in Somalia, 

including in Somaliland. We are supportive of dialogue 

between Somaliland and neighbouring Puntland, and with 

the Federal Government of Somalia on areas of mutual 

interest. 

In Somaliland, the UK is an active member of a group 

of international donors which provide technical, financial 

and political support to the National Electoral 

Commission and the broader electoral cycle in 

Somaliland. This included £2.18million in UK support to 

plan, prepare and deliver biometric voter registration in 

Somaliland. 

Southern Africa: Elections 

Asked by Lord Oates 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government when they last 

held discussions with the Chair of the Southern African 

Development Community (SADC) about SADC’s 

commitment to ensuring free and fair elections in 

SADC member states. [HL6272] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: The UK representative 

to the Southern African Development Community 

(SADC) participated in the annual general conference of 

the Electoral Commission Forum of SADC countries in 

August 2016, attended by President Khama of Botswana, 

the previous Chair of SADC. We also regularly 

emphasise the importance of free, fair and credible 

elections, in accordance with SADC's own guidelines, in 

our bilateral dialogues with countries in the region. We 

are also providing practical support, for example, we 

accredited a team of observers to last year's local elections 

in South Africa and will do the same for this year's 

general elections in Lesotho. Her Majesty's Government 

is also working through a multi-donor programme to 

improve the electoral environment in advance of elections 

in Zimbabwe in 2018 

Syria: Females 

Asked by Baroness Afshar 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what steps they 

are taking to protect the rights of women in Syria, as 

part of their overseas operations in that country. 

[HL6162] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: All of the projects the 

UK funds through the Conflict Stability and Security 

Fund in Syria incorporate awareness of gender equality 

issues and work to promote the empowerment of women. 

In particular, we have supported women-led projects 

through a governance programme, which has enabled 

women to participate in community engagement 

activities, project development and decision-making at the 

local level. 

Zimbabwe: South Africa 

Asked by Lord Oates 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment 

they have made of the impact on the Zimbabwe 

economy of the announcement by the South African 

Home Affairs Minister on 7 February that 

Zimbabweans who previously acquired permits to 

work, conduct business, or study in South Africa under 

special dispensation will have to follow the normal 

channel of applying for work and study visas when their 

permits expire in December, and of the extent to which 

those new requirements will lead to Zimbabweans 

holding such permits losing their jobs and rights of 

residence. [HL6270] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: The South African 

Government has the right to apply their own rules about 

visas and work and study permits. It is for the South 

African and Zimbabwean authorities to comment on the 

impact this might have on the Zimbabwean economy and 

on jobs held by Zimbabweans in South Africa.
