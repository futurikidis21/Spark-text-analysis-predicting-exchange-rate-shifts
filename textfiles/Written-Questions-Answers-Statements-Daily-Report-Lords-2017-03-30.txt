Architects Registration Board 

[HLWS583] 

Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth: Today, My Hon. Friend 

the Minister for Housing and Planning and Minister for 

London (Gavin Barwell), has made the following Written 

Ministerial Statement: 

The UK has a reputation for the high quality of its 

architectural profession. To maintain that reputation it is 

important that anyone who hires an architect can be 

assured of their competence. This is partly why we have a 

system of regulation under the Architects Act where 

nobody can use the title of architect unless they are 

registered with the Architects Registration Board (ARB). 

However it is critical that the Board conducts its 

regulatory function in a way that is proportionate, cost 

effective and transparent and does not impose 

unnecessary burdens on those wishing to practice as 

architects. 

The ARB has been the subject of a periodic review, in 

line with Cabinet Office guidance for reviews of arms 

length bodies. I am today publishing the report of that 

review. This confirms the decision taken by the last 

Government to continue light touch regulation of 

architects based on protection of title to provide 

protection for home owners, businesses, builders and 

others commissioning work from architects. 

The ARB also acts as the UK Competent Authority 

Role for Architects under the Mutual Recognition of 

Professional Qualifications Directive. Whilst the UK 

remains a member of the European Union, ARB will 

continue to play that role but this will be kept under 

review in the light of any arrangements made as the UK 

leaves the EU. 

We have been grateful for suggestions about how to 

modernise the operation of the Board and the review has 

identified a number of opportunities to reduce costs and 

improve services. These include strengthening the 

Board’s governance and accountability and improving the 

complaints’ handling and disciplinary processes. It is the 

Government’s intention to implement these 

recommendations. 

The Review also made a number of recommendations 

relating to the way in which qualifications are set which 

entitle people to register as architects. These 

recommendations could lead to extensive change for UK 

architects, and architectural education but also relate 

directly to UK compliance with the EU Mutual 

Recognition of Professional Qualifications Directive. The 

Government has decided that it would be premature to 

take forward these recommendations at this time but as 

the UK leaves the EU, we recognise these will need to be 

addressed. This will minimise disruption and cost to 

business, architects and the educational sector. 

The Government is grateful for the work of the Board 

in delivering its role. The recommendations of the review 

will enable the Board to serve both architects and their 

clients even more effectively and the Government looks 

forward to working with the Board on implementing 

them. 

I am placing a copy of the review report in the library 

of both Houses. 

Business Rates: Plant Nurseries 

[HLWS585] 

Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth: Today, My Hon Friend 

the Minister for Local Government (Marcus Jones) has 

made the following Written Ministerial Statement: 

Since at least 1928, plant nursery grounds have been 

treated by the Valuation Office Agency as exempt from 

business rates as part of the general exemption for 

agriculture. However, following a recent Court of Appeal 

decision, the Valuation Office Agency has started to bring 

into business rates buildings at nursery grounds including 

structures such as poly-tunnels. 

The exemption for agricultural properties is an 

important part of the rating system. It ensures that large 

areas of agricultural land and buildings are not liable to a 

property tax which could have a significant impact on the 

cost of farming. I can confirm to the House that the 

Government’s policy is that land and buildings at plant 

nursery grounds should benefit from the agricultural 

exemption for business rates. 

Therefore, we intend at the soonest opportunity to 

amend the Local Government Finance Act 1988 to ensure 

both agricultural land and buildings at plant nursery 

grounds are exempt from business rates. This will return 

the law to align with the practice followed by the 

Valuation Office Agency before the decision in the Court 

of Appeal. 

Cabinet Committees 

[HLWS587] 

Lord Young of Cookham: My Right Honourable 

friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster 

General (Ben Gummer) has made the following Written 

Ministerial Statement. 

Today the Government is publishing an updated list of 

Cabinet Committees and Implementation Taskforces. As 

part of the changes, the Prime Minister will chair two new 

Sub-Committees of the European Union Exit and Trade 

Committee. 

The two new Sub-Committees are as follows: 

• European Union Exit and Trade (Negotiations) Sub-

Committee: to oversee the negotiations on the UK’s 

withdrawal from, and future relationship with, the 

European Union. 

• European Union Exit and Trade (International Trade) 

Sub-Committee: to focus on issues relating to the UK’s 

trading arrangements with non-European Union countries.

Companies House Public Targets 2017-18 

[HLWS577] 

Lord Prior of Brampton: I have set Companies House 

the following targets for the year 2017/18: 

i) To digitally enable 99% of all possible accounts 

filings 

ii) To achieve an 87% take up of our digital filing 

services 

iii) To maintain an availability of our digital services of 

99.9% 

iv) To reach a compliance level of 75% of confirmation 

statements filed early or on time 

v) To reach a compliance level of 95% of accounts filed 

early or on time 

vi) To reduce the costs of our baseline activities by 

3.5% 

vii) To achieve a customer satisfaction score of at least 

88% 

These targets reflect the key priorities for Companies 

House in the coming year, with a focus on moving 

customers away from paper to digital channels, and 

ensuring the register is up to date. 

Convergence Programme 

[HLWS582] 

Baroness Neville-Rolfe: My right honourable friend 

the Chief Secretary to the Treasury (David Gauke) has 

today made the following Written Ministerial Statement. 

Article 121 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the 

European Union (TFEU) requires the UK to send an 

annual Convergence Programme to the European 

Commission reporting upon its fiscal situation and 

policies. The UK’s Convergence Programme will be sent 

to the European Commission by 30 April. This deadline 

was set in accordance with the European Semester 

timetable for both Convergence and National Reform 

Programmes. The UK will continue to have all of the 

rights, obligations and benefits that membership brings up 

until the point we leave the EU, and as such the 

Government will continue to submit the UK’s 

Convergence Programme until that time. 

Section 5 of the European Communities (Amendment) 

Act 1993 requires that the content of the Convergence 

Programme must be drawn from an assessment of the 

UK’s economic and budgetary position which has been 

presented to Parliament by the Government for its 

approval. This assessment is based on the Budget 2017 

report and the most recent Office for Budget 

Responsibility’s Economic and Fiscal Outlook and it is 

this content, not the Convergence Programme itself, 

which requires the approval of the House for the purposes 

of the Act. 

Article 121, along with Article 126 of the TFEU, is the 

legal basis for the Stability and Growth Pact, which is the 

co-ordination mechanism for EU fiscal policies and 

requires Member States to avoid excessive government 

deficits. Although the UK participates in the Stability and 

Growth Pact, by virtue of its protocol to the treaty opting 

out of the euro, it is only required to "endeavour to avoid" 

excessive deficits. Unlike the euro area Member States, 

the UK is not subject to sanctions at any stage of the 

European Semester process. 

Subject to the progress of parliamentary business, 

debates will be held soon in both the House of Commons 

and the House of Lords, in order for both Houses to 

approve this assessment before the Convergence 

Programme is sent to the Commission. While the 

Convergence Programme itself is not subject to 

parliamentary approval or amendment, I will deposit 

advanced copies of the document in the Libraries of both 

Houses and copies will be available through the Vote 

Office and Printed Paper Office. 

The UK's Convergence Programme will be available 

electronically via HM Treasury’s website prior to it being 

sent to the European Commission. 

Dartford-Thurrock Crossing Charging 

Scheme 

[HLWS574] 

Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon: My Honourable Friend, 

the Minister of State for Transport (John Hayes) has made 

the following Ministerial Statement. 

The Dartford–Thurrock Crossing Charging Scheme 

account for 2015-16 is published today under Section 3 

(1) (d) of the Trunk Road Charging Schemes (Bridges and 

Tunnels) (Keeping of Accounts) (England) Regulations 

2003. A copy of the accounts will be placed in the 

Libraries of both Houses.

Justice Update 

[HLWS581] 

Baroness Buscombe: My right honourable friend the 

Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice has 

made the following Written Statement: 

"As I committed on 27th February, when I set the new 

discount rate, I am today launching a six week 

consultation on how the Personal Injury Discount Rate, 

used to help calculate lump sum payments of damages in 

personal injury claims, should be set in the future. The 

consultation document is available at: 

https://consult.justice.gov.uk/digital-

communications/personal-injury-discount-rate. 

It is a long standing principle under our system that 

people who suffer injuries wrongfully at the hands of 

others should be compensated fully, and put in the 

financial position they would have been had the injury not 

happened. Where damages are awarded for future loss in 

the form of a lump sum, that award is adjusted to take 

account of the effect of the injured person being able to 

invest the money before the loss or expense for which it is 

awarded has actually occurred. The factor by which the 

award is adjusted is determined by the discount rate. 

Under the Damages Act 1996, the Lord Chancellor has 

the power to set the discount rate from time to time. The 

rate must be set in accordance with the Act and the 

applicable legal principles set out in case law, particularly 

the 1998 House of Lords case of Wells v Wells. The 

principles in Wells v Wells lead to the conclusion that the 

discount rate should be based on the investment portfolio 

that offers the least risk to personal injury claimant 

investors in protecting an award of damages against 

inflation and against market risk. A change to the current 

legal framework would need primary legislation. 

The power to set the discount rate was used first in 

2001, when Lord Irvine set the rate at 2.5% by reference 

to a three year average of real yields on index-linked gilts 

(ILGs). Following a review, I announced a change to the 

rate on 27 February this year to minus 0.75%, which came 

into force on 20 March. In doing so, I pledged to review 

the current law to consider: whether the rate should in 

future be set by an independent body; whether more 

frequent reviews would improve predictability and 

certainty for all parties; and whether the methodology – 

which in effect assumes that claimants would invest only 

in virtually risk-free ILGs – is appropriate for the future. 

The consultation document I am publishing today 

covers these points, and includes a call for evidence on 

how investors in the position of personal injury claimants 

are likely to invest. The consultation document explores 

what an appropriate investment risk profile could look 

like for such investors, and what the effect would be of 

moving from the current virtually risk-free model, to a 

low-risk model. Whilst my responsibility extends only to 

England and Wales, the principles and method for setting 

the rate have read across to all jurisdictions in the UK, 

and the consultation is produced in partnership with the 

Scottish Government. 

We must have a justice system that works for all. I fully 

recognise the impact that the discount rate has, not just on 

claimants (including some of the most vulnerable in 

society), but also on defendants in both the public and 

private sectors, and the further impact this has on 

consumers’ insurance premiums and taxpayers. The 

consultation I am launching today will look at the way the 

rate is set in future, and I am inviting anyone with 

evidence and expertise to take part. The consultation will 

close on 11 May." 

Light Dues 2017-18 

[HLWS578] 

Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon: My Honourable Friend, 

the Minister of State for Transport (John Hayes) has made 

the following Ministerial Statement. 

A strong and growing maritime industry is vital to the 

economy of the United Kingdom and it is critical that we 

treasure and protect this vital artery if we are to remain a 

world-leading maritime centre. 

The work of the General Lighthouse Authorities, which 

provide and maintain marine aids to navigation and 

respond to new wrecks and navigation dangers in some of

Page 4 30 March 2017 Written Statements 

the busiest waters in the world, is crucial to underpinning 

that vision whilst maintaining our vigorous safety record 

and continuously improving standards of safety. 

Reductions in the three General Lighthouse Authorities’ 

running costs has already enabled the UK to reduce light 

dues for three successive years. 

For 2017-18 I intend to cut light dues by a further half a 

penny to 37½p per net registered tonne. This will mean 

that light dues will have fallen by 25 per cent in real terms 

since 2010. 

Light dues rates will continue to be reviewed on an 

annual basis to ensure that the General Lighthouse 

Authorities are challenged to provide an effective and 

efficient service which offers value for money to light 

dues payers while maintaining the highest levels of safety 

for mariners.

Personal Independence Payment 

[HLWS575] 

Lord Henley: My honourable Friend The Minister of 

State for Disabled People, Health and Work (Penny 

Mordaunt MP) has made the following Written Statement. 

The Second Independent Review of the Personal 

Independence Payment Assessment by Paul Gray is being 

published today. This is the second of the two 

Independent Reviews as required by the Welfare Reform 

Act 2012. 

Building on the recommendations from the First 

Independent Review, Paul Gray has explored how closely 

the on-going implementation of the Personal 

Independence Payment reflects the policy intent. He has 

considered: 

• How effectively further evidence is being used to 

assist the correct claim decision, and the speed and 

effectiveness of information-gathering; 

• The degree of claimant confidence and transparency 

in the claim process; and 

• How to further promote quality and consistency to 

produce fair outcomes for all. 

The Government welcomes the publication of the 

Review and will consider its findings and issue a detailed 

response in due course.

Written Statements 30 March 2017 Page 5 

Primary Assessment in England 

[HLWS584] 

Lord Nash: My right honourable friend the Secretary 

of State for Education (Justine Greening) has made the 

following Written Ministerial Statement. 

Last October, I made a statement to Parliament about 

the primary assessment and accountability system in 

England. In that statement, I reaffirmed the importance of 

a good primary education, and particularly the importance 

of mastering the basics of literacy and numeracy, to 

ensure that every child is given the best chance to succeed 

in life, whatever their background. I also recognised that 

we must move to a settled system which is ambitious, 

supports teachers to help every child to reach their 

potential, allows schools to benchmark their own 

performance, and enables them to be held to account in a 

way that is fair and accurate. 

Since then, we have taken a number of steps to improve 

the operation of the assessment system. We have worked 

with the teaching profession to produce new guidance for 

the moderation of teacher assessment, to improve the 

quality and consistency of that moderation, and we have 

provided additional training for local authority 

moderators. We have also taken steps to improve the test 

experience for pupils this year. 

We have also talked to headteachers, teachers and 

others about the longer-term issues that need to be 

resolved to establish a settled, sustainable system. We are 

today launching a public consultation on the primary 

assessment system in England. Our consultation 

document, ‘Primary Assessment in England’, sets out 

wide-ranging proposals for improving our primary 

assessment system. These include how the system can 

help to prepare children to succeed at school, the starting 

point from which to measure the progress that children 

make in primary school, how we can ensure that the 

primary assessment system is proportionate, and how end 

of key stage assessment can be improved, particularly in 

the case of the statutory teacher assessment frameworks. 

It is important that our assessment system can assess the 

progress and attainment of children of all abilities. The 

report of the independent Rochford Review, also 

published last October, set out a number of 

recommendations to improve the way that the attainment 

and progress of children working below the level of the 

national curriculum tests is assessed in primary schools. 

The recommendations, if adopted, would result in 

significant changes and it is important that we hear the 

views of those who would be affected, and particularly 

teachers and others working with children who have 

special educational needs. That is why we are today also 

publishing a consultation document on the Rochford 

proposals and their possible implementation. 

During the consultation period, which will last for 12 

weeks, we want to hear from as many headteachers and 

teachers as possible to gather their views and feed them 

into our final decisions. I would encourage all those with 

an interest in primary education to engage with these 

consultation exercises and to share their opinions and 

insights. 

Copies of these consultation documents have been 

placed in the libraries of both Houses of Parliament. 

UK Anti-Doping Tailored Review 

[HLWS586] 

Lord Ashton of Hyde: My Hon Friend the 

Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Sport, 

Tourism and Heritage (Tracey Crouch) has made the 

following Statement: 

I am announcing today the start of a tailored review of 

UK Anti-Doping (UKAD). 

The principle aims of Tailored Reviews are to ensure 

public bodies remain fit for purpose, are well governed 

and properly accountable for what they do:

UK Anti-Doping is the UK’s National Anti-Doping 

Organisation responsible for ensuring sports in the UK are 

compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code. UKAD is 

sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and 

Sport, and implements and manages the Government’s 

National Anti-Doping Policy. 

The Review will consider UKAD’s position and its 

status as a DCMS-sponsored Non-Departmental Public 

Body (NDPB), and if the functions of UKAD are 

appropriate. If they are found to be, then the review will 

go on to to consider UKAD’s efficiency, effectiveness 

and governance; and how it is preparing for the future. 

The review process and findings will be examined by a 

Challenge Group, chaired by DCMS Non-Executive 

Director, Matthew Campbell-Hill. 

In conducting the review, officials will engage with a 

broad range of stakeholders across the UK (and further 

afield) in sport, science, medicine, law enforcement and 

education, and they will explore best practice in the public 

and private sectors. The review will follow guidance 

published in 2016 by the Cabinet Office: ‘Tailored 

reviews: guidance on reviews of public bodies’. The 

Terms of Reference for the review and a public survey 

consultation about the work of UKAD can be found on 

gov.uk . 

I will inform the House of the outcome of the review 

when it is completed and copies of the report of the 

review will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

Atrial Fibrillation 

Asked by Lord Black of Brentwood 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

Written Answer by Lord Prior of Brampton on 13 June 

2016 (HL459), whether the National Institute for Health 

Research project HTA-14/141/01 on screening 

strategies for atrial fibrillation is still expected to be 

published in spring 2017. [HL6361] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: The researchers involved in 

National Institute for Health Research project HTA 

14/141/01 are currently considering how to disseminate 

their findings most effectively. As a result, the project 

findings will not be available in spring 2017. Further 

information will be available when the publication 

timeline is clarified. 

Bahrain: Politics and Government 

Asked by Lord Hylton 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what plans they 

have to help prevent renewed political violence in 

Bahrain, in the light of recent reports of executions, 

arrests and deprivations of citizenship in that country. 

[HL6131] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: We continue to urge the 

Government of Bahrain to guarantee and protect political 

freedoms for all its citizens. We also work closely with 

the Government of Bahrain to encourage progress on 

human rights and to encourage the development of 

effective and accountable institutions, strengthening the 

rule of law and justice reform. In particular the UK 

continues to support oversight institutions, such as the 

Ministry of Interior Ombudsman and the Prisoners and 

Detainees Rights Commission, in order to provide 

independent oversight of police behaviour and detention 

standards. 

The Government of Bahrain is fully aware of our 

opposition to the use of capital sentences in all 

circumstances. The Foreign Secretary reiterated this in his 

public statement on 15 January. We will continue to raise 

this issue, and other human rights concerns, with the 

Bahraini authorities. 

Cameroon: Internet 

Asked by Baroness Northover 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what 

representations they have made to the government of 

Cameroon, in the light of reports regarding the 

suspension of internet and email services from the 

English-speaking regions of that country. [HL6137] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: The British High 

Commission in Yaoundé has petitioned the Government 

of Cameroon to restore the internet as soon as possible to 

areas in the North West and South West regions of 

Cameroon as soon as possible. We have reiterated the 

obligation to uphold human rights standards and called on 

the authorities to allow all Cameroonians to voice their 

concerns peacefully and without hindrance. 

Child Rearing 

Asked by Lord Farmer 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how much was 

spent by the Social Mobility Commission on preparing 

and publishing its report Helping Parents to Parent, 

published in February 2017. [HL6309] 

Lord Nash: We welcome the Commission’s ‘Helping 

parents to parent’ report, published in February. The 

report was commissioned by the Social Mobility 

Commission to bring together evidence on parenting 

behaviours and the extent to which public policy can 

support parents. It examined 28 interventions and 

programmes in the United Kingdom and internationally. 

The research was tendered in an open competition 

process and the successful bid was put forward by the 

market and social research agency, Family Kids and 

Youth, which carried out the research. The amount for 

this research contract is £10,350 (exclusive of VAT) and 

this is in line with the total project spend. 

Children: Poverty 

Asked by Lord Bird 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government in the light of  An 

evidence review of the drivers of child poverty for 

families in poverty now and for poor children growing 

up to be poor adults  (Cm 8781), published in January 

2014, which stated that much of the difference in 

attainment between pupils relates to their individual 

characteristics rather than the effectiveness of the 

school they attend, and the closure of the Child Poverty 

Unit, what steps they are taking in respect of children’s 

primary school tuition, other than ensuring an effective 

education, to improve the outcomes of poor children 

and alleviate the cycle of poverty. [HL6149] 

Lord Nash: Since 2011 schools have received 

significant extra funding through the pupil premium to 

accelerate the progress and development of their poorest 

pupils. Schools assess the needs of each eligible pupil 

and, using the evidence of what works best, choose the 

most effective approaches to overcome barriers to 

achievement. The government has established the 

Education Endowment Foundation to research how best 

to accelerate progress and share the findings with schools. 

Since the introduction of the pupil premium the gap 

between disadvantaged pupils and their peers has 

decreased by 9.3% in primary schools. By introducing a 

new progress measure for pupil performance in 2016 we

are ensuring that schools focus on realising the potential 

of every one of their pupils, rather than concentrating on 

achievement alone. 

Climate Change 

Asked by Lord Donoughue 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

Written Answer by Lord Prior of Brampton on 14 

March (HL5780), whether their statement that the 

increase in global average surface temperatures is not 

consistent with natural internal variability is supported 

by evidence that is not based upon computer simulation 

of the climate. [HL6226] 

Lord Prior of Brampton: Our statement reflects the 

conclusion of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 

Change Fifth Assessment Report that it is virtually certain 

(>99% probability) that natural internal variability alone 

cannot account for the observed increase in global surface 

temperatures. This statement is based on computer model 

simulations, which capture both the observed magnitude 

and spatial patterns of warming only when both human 

and natural forcings are included. Further, reconstructions 

of past climate variability from records such as ice cores 

also reveal that recent temperature changes are clearly 

distinct from natural variability. These records show that 

temperatures over the last 50 years in the Northern 

Hemisphere (where records of past climate are most 

comprehensive) were unusually high relative to the last 

1000 years. 

Entry Clearances: Overseas Students 

Asked by Lord Green of Deddington 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how many 

applicants for a Tier 4 (General) student visa, or its 

previous equivalent, have been interviewed as part of 

the application process in each year since 2006. 

[HL6313] 

Baroness Williams of Trafford: I am sorry but the 

information requested is not included in statistics 

published by the Home Office. 

Asked by Lord Green of Deddington 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how many 

applications were received in each year from 2010 to 

2016 for a Tier 4 (General) student visa using sponsor 

acceptances from a Russell Group higher education 

institution. [HL6315] 

Baroness Williams of Trafford: Information on the 

total number of applicants for visas for study at Higher 

Education Institutions using sponsor acceptances is 

published in Sponsorship table cs_09 in the Home 

Office’s ‘Immigration Statistics, October - December 

2016’, available from

Health Services: Learning Disability 

Asked by Baroness McIntosh of Pickering 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, in the light of the 

commitment made in  Transferring Care for People 

with Learning Disabilities - Next Steps, published in 

January 2015, to establish a reconfiguration taskforce to 

support local leaders to reshape services in the north of 

England, what progress they have made in this regard. 

[HL6172] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: Since January 2015 significant 

progress has been made against this commitment in the 

North of England. 

Work was undertaken in in the summer of 2015 in 

designated ‘Fast Track’ areas, including in Lancashire, 

Greater Manchester and Cumbria and the North East 

region. Funding was provided to these areas to pilot the 

transformation of services in line with the new Building 

the Right Support (BRS) service model. Each Fast Track 

area focussed on the development of different services 

elements, but all demonstrated the local leadership and 

governance required to reshape services in these areas. To 

support this work, additional resources were provided for 

dedicated NHS regional teams in both the North and 

Midlands and East regions. Learning from this work in 

2015 informed the broader roll-out of the BRS strategy 

from April 2016.

Transforming Care Partnerships (TCPs) were rolled out 

from April 2016 nationally, with 10 being developed in 

the North. In the past 12 months, each TCP has developed 

a leadership and governance structure, set out a 

transformation plan, and begun developing services as 

part of a three year programme of delivery. At the 

regional level, a North Transforming Care Board is 

attended by all relevant TCP Senior Responsible Officers, 

with senior representation from all partnership bodies 

including NHS England, the Local Government 

Association, voluntary sector partners as well as people 

with lived experience. This Board is key for assuring and 

challenging the planning and delivery undertaken by 

TCPs. It also provides an opportunity for shared learning 

and development. 

Health: Screening 

Asked by Lord Black of Brentwood 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how many 

Clinical Commissioning Groups have added pulse 

checking to GP- or pharmacy-enhanced services for 

people aged over 65. [HL6363] 

Lord O'Shaughnessy: This information is not held by 

the Department or NHS England, as general practice and 

pharmacy contracts do not mandate pulse checks as part 

of the existing enhanced services for people over 65. 

In England, however, all local authorities are required 

to offer the NHS Health Check programme, with the large 

majority commissioning general practice to provide them 

on their behalf. Between 2014 and 2018, over 15 million 

people aged 40–74 are, have been or will be eligible for 

an NHS Health Check. The programme’s best practice 

guidance recommends that a pulse check is carried out as 

part of the process of taking a blood pressure reading and 

that those individuals who are found to have an irregular 

pulse rhythm should be referred for further investigation. 

Higher Education and Research Bill 

Asked by Lord Triesman 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government which 

consultancies or associated companies were retained to 

advise on any part of the reforms introduced in the 

Higher Education and Research Bill; what briefs were 

provided to those companies; and what fees were 

agreed. [HL6188] 

Viscount Younger of Leckie: No consultancies were 

retained in the preparation of the reforms or to provide 

advice on the reforms during the passage of the Higher 

Education and Research Bill. Some consultancy advice 

has been sought on specific areas to support the 

implementation of the Bill, including the provision of 

expert HR advice to support the ministerial appointments 

and advice on the IT requirements for the new Office for 

Students. Advice was also commissioned from Deloitte to 

undertake preliminary organisational design work ahead 

of the establishment of UK Research and Innovation 

(UKRI). 

Asked by Lord Triesman 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government whether they 

intend to publish all research and consultancy reports 

prepared by consultancies or associated companies on 

any aspect of the preparation of reforms introduced by 

the Higher Education and Research Bill in the last three 

years. [HL6189] 

Viscount Younger of Leckie: The policy work that 

underpinned the reforms introduced by the Higher 

Education and Research Bill (HER Bill) was largely 

undertaken by civil servants and drew on previous 

published material including, for example, the Gaskell 

Review that was prepared for Universities UK. This 

material was referenced in the Green Paper published in 

October 2015 and again in the White Paper in May 2016 

that preceded the introduction of the HER Bill. 

BEIS commissioned Deloitte to undertake preliminary 

organisational design work ahead of the establishment of 

UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), working with 

BEIS, the UKRI Interim Chair and senior leaders from the 

existing Partner Organisations which will form UKRI. 

The brief was to set out high level organisation design 

principles, assumptions and options for UKRI consistent 

with the framework set out by the White Paper and the 

HER Bill. The work was completed in October 2016 as 

preliminary specialist advice for BEIS officials and 

ministers to inform further organisational design work 

being carried out within BEIS and hence it is not planned 

to publish the commissioned report. 

Immigration: EU Nationals 

Asked by Lord Alton of Liverpool 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

Written Answer by Baroness Williams of Trafford on 

23 March (HL6077), whether they will prepare and 

publish a draft bill with a view to its introduction as 

soon as agreement on the rights of EU citizens to 

remain in the UK has been reached. [HL6327] 

Baroness Williams of Trafford: Securing the status of 

EU nationals in the UK, and UK citizens in the EU, is one 

of the Government’s twelve key objectives for exit and 

we are looking to reach agreement on this point as early 

as possible once formal negotiations begin. 

We will publish further information on this issue in due 

course. 

Indian Ocean: Piracy 

Asked by Lord Luce 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what estimate they 

have made of the level of piracy in the Indian Ocean off 

the coast of (1) Yemen, (2) Somalia, and (3) Kenya, in 

each of the last five years. [HL6133]

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: The number of acts of 

piracy in the Western Indian Ocean has reduced sharply 

in recent years. According to the EU's counter-piracy 

mission, EUNAVFOR Operation Atalanta, there were 11 

reported piracy related attacks on commercial vessels in 

the region in the last five years. Of those, only one – an 

attack against a Comoros flagged oil tanker, the Aris 13, 

on 13 March 2017 – was successful. By contrast, in 2011, 

there were 176 reported piracy attacks. 

Israel: Gaza 

Asked by Lord Polak 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment 

they have made of reports of renewed construction of 

tunnels into Israel by Hamas; and of the impact of those 

tunnels on progress towards a two-state solution. 

[HL6140] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: We remain deeply 

concerned by Hamas attempts to rearm and rebuild 

militant infrastructure, including the tunnel network in 

Gaza. Hamas rearmament undermines efforts to improve 

the situation in Gaza and harms the prospects for peace 

and stability in the Middle East. 

Motorcycles: Theft 

Asked by Viscount Goschen 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how many 

instances of motorcycle theft have been reported in 

each of the past three financial years; and how many 

successful prosecutions have been brought over the 

same period. [HL6230] 

Baroness Williams of Trafford: The Home Office 

does not hold the requested information centrally. 

Statistics on theft or unauthorised taking of a motor 

vehicle, which will include motorcycles, are regularly 

published by the Office for National Statistics. This can 

be found in Table A4 of the latest Crime in England and 

Wales publication. 

Information on prosecutions is the responsibility of the 

Ministry of Justice. They have informed us that they do 

not hold the requested data. 

Overseas Students: Loans 

Asked by Baroness Deech 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment 

they have made of the effectiveness of methods of 

recovery of student loans from overseas students. 

[HL6303] 

Viscount Younger of Leckie: The Student Loans 

Company publishes an annual statistical first release on 

student loans in England that provides statistics on loan 

outlays, repayment of loans and borrower activity. The 

latest release is attached. 

In addition to this, in February 2016 the Department 

published a Joint Repayment Strategy which includes an 

assessment of actions to trace borrowers and to recover 

loans where avoidance or evasion is identified. This 

publication is also attached.

Religious Freedom 

Asked by Baroness Berridge 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how much of the 

Magna Carta Fund for Human Rights and Democracy 

will be allocated in 2017–18 to projects on freedom of 

religion or belief. [HL6121] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: Projects that directly 

support freedom of religion or belief remain an important 

element of the Magna Carta Fund programme. In 2017/18 

the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will spend 

£758,717 across six freedom of religion or belief projects. 

This equates to 7.2 percent of next year's Magna Carta 

Fund allocation and represents an increase on the funding 

awarded in 2016/17. This demonstrates Her Majesty's 

Government's continued commitment to supporting 

freedom of religion or belief worldwide. 

Schools 

Asked by Lord Laird 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how they define 

(1) public schools, (2) grammar schools, (3) academy 

schools, and (4) high schools. [HL6354] 

Lord Nash:  1) ‘Public school’ is not a term set out in 

legislation, but is used commonly to refer to an 

‘independent school,’ as defined with Section 463 of the 

Education Act 1996. 

2) ‘Grammar schools’ are the 163 schools which were 

designated as such within the Education (Grammar 

School Designation) Order 1998 (as amended). Originally 

all grammar schools were maintained grammar schools, 

however, 140 have now become wholly selective 

academies. 

3) Academy schools are State funded independent 

schools, as defined in Section 1A of the Academies Act 

2010 (as amended). 

4) ‘Higher school’ is not a term set out in legislation, 

but is used commonly to refer to a ‘secondary school’ that 

caters mainly for key stage 4 pupils and perhaps key stage 

5 pupils.

Sex and Relationship Education 

Asked by Lord Northbourne 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government whether the 

recently introduced obligation requiring all secondary 

schools to teach sex and relationship education requires 

schools to teach pupils about important relationships 

other than sexual relationships, particularly the 

relationships between fathers and sons. [HL6269] 

Lord Nash: The government announced on 1 March 

2017 proposals for statutory Relationships Education in 

primary schools, Relationships and Sex Education in 

secondary schools (RSE) and Personal, Social, Health and 

Economic Education (PSHE), subject to careful 

consideration, in all schools. We want all pupils to be 

taught how to recognise and build healthy relationships of 

all kinds, including family relationships, friendships and, 

at the appropriate age, sexual relationships. 

We plan to undertake a comprehensive programme of 

engagement with stakeholders about future provision in 

these areas. A key element of the engagement process will 

be gathering views and evidence to enable us to get the 

balance of subject content right, including through 

statutory guidance, enabling schools to design appropriate 

lessons. Regulations and statutory guidance will be 

subject to a full public consultation later this year and the 

regulations will be subject to debate and vote in 

Parliament. 

The government’s plan is for schools to teach statutory 

Relationships Education, RSE, and PSHE (subject to 

consideration and consultation), from September 2019. 

All pupils currently have the opportunity to learn about 

relationships in the non-statutory PSHE, or as part of the 

wider school curriculum. Schools are free to draw on the 

non-statutory programme of study produced by the PSHE 

Association in planning their provision. The programme 

of study includes topics, such as relationships and the 

value of family relationships. 

Social Mobility Commission 

Asked by Lord Farmer 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how much has 

been spent on the running of the Social Mobility 

Commission since it was first established as the Social 

Mobility and Child Poverty Commission. [HL6307] 

Lord Nash: The Commission’s first full year of 

operation was 2013-14 and they have spent a total amount 

of £2,029,695 to date. This figure includes spend on 

commissioned research. To note that this is based on 

spend up until 29 March 2017 and does not cover full 

spend for 2016-17. 

Asked by Lord Farmer 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government how much has

[HL6308] 

Lord Nash: The Commission’s first full year of 

operation was 2013-14 and they have spent a total of 

£337,913 on commissioned research to date. To note that 

this is based on spend up until 29 March 2017 and does 

not cover full spend for 2016-17.

in 2017–18; and (3) alongside those figures, what are 

the estimated costs to local authorities for funding the 

National Living Wage for employees providing adult 

social care on behalf of local authorities in 2016–17 and 

2017–18. [HL6250] 

Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth: For estimates of the 

amount that could be raised in 2017-18, I refer to the 

Department's response to the written question (attached) 

HL4037 answered on 28 December 2016, which sets out 

the potential revenue raised for all local authorities: 

www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-

questions-answers-statements/written-

question/Lords/2016-12-12/HL4037/. 

My department has made no assessment as to (3). 

Spending Review decisions on social care services took 

into account a range of financial and economic factors, 

including projections and data including on the National 

Living Wage from the Office of Budget Responsibility 

and Skills for Care.

South Sudan: Famine 

Asked by Baroness Kinnock of Holyhead 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, in the light of the 

declaration by UNICEF and the Food and Agriculture 

Organisation that 100,000 civilians are at risk of 

starvation in two counties in South Sudan, and that one 

million are on the brink of famine, what assessment 

they have made of the actions by the leadership of 

South Sudan to resolve those issues. [HL6132] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: We remain deeply 

concerned by the increasingly desperate humanitarian 

situation in South Sudan. The continued obstruction of aid 

agencies by the Government of South Sudan, and 

restrictions on humanitarian access across the country, is 

particularly troubling. In addition, the proposal to increase 

the cost of work permits would hinder the response to the 

worsening famine. Together with our international 

partners we raised these issues with the South Sudanese 

First Vice President on 15 March, and made clear that the 

Government of South Sudan has a responsibility to stop 

the suffering of its own people, and allow full 

humanitarian access across the country. The Foreign 

Secretary made these points when he chaired a Security 

Council meeting on South Sudan in New York on 23 

March. 

Syria: War Crimes 

Asked by Lord Hylton 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, in the light of the 

UN General Assembly adopting resolution 71/248 

establishing an independent mechanism to assist in the 

investigation and prosecution of those responsible for 

war crimes committed in Syria, what steps they will 

take to ensure that its terms of reference are wide 

enough to cover crimes committed by anti-government 

groups of all kinds. [HL6129] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: The terms of reference, 

which have been approved by the UN Secretary General, 

set out that the International, Impartial and Independent 

Mechanism will assist in the investigation and 

prosecution of persons without any distinction based on 

their affiliation or official capacity. The Mechanism will 

look at those responsible for the most serious crimes 

under international law committed in the Syrian Arab 

Republic since March 2011. 

Taxation 

Asked by Lord Myners 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government, further to the 

statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (HC Deb, 

col 821) where he referred to the "death tax", what is 

the meaning of that term. [HL6155] 

Baroness Neville-Rolfe: The term “death tax” was 

used to refer to a levy applied to all estates in order to 

fund adult social care. 

The government will set out proposals to reform the 

social care system in a green paper in due course. 

However, proposals do not include, and never have 

included, any kind of death tax. 

Yesh Din: Grants 

Asked by Lord Polak 

To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment 

has been made of the value for money to the UK 

taxpayer of the 690,189 shekels (£154,000) grant given 

to Yesh Din in 2016. [HL6139] 

Baroness Anelay of St Johns: Each project funded by 

the UK is in line with British Government policy. The 

money allocated to Yesh Din supported our objective of 

preserving the viability of a two-state solution.
